Discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of Part\u00a0II,\u00a0Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\u00a0Results are impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic, political, and capital markets conditions.\n\n The Company operates in more than 70 countries and derives approximately 60 percent of its revenues from outside the United States. The Company\u2019s business is subject to global competition and geopolitical risks and may be adversely affected by factors in the United States and other countries that are beyond its control, such as slower economic growth, disruptions in financial markets, economic downturns in the form of either contained or widespread recessionary \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\nconditions, inflation, elevated unemployment levels, sluggish or uneven recovery, government deficit reduction and other austerity measures in specific countries or regions, or in the various industries in which the Company operates; social, political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions; natural and other disasters or climate change affecting the operations of the Company or its customers and suppliers; or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital, interest rates, tax rates, tax laws, or exchange control, ability to expatriate earnings and other regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\u00a0Change in the Company\u2019s credit ratings could increase cost of funding.\n\n The Company\u2019s credit ratings are important to 3M\u2019s cost of capital. The major rating agencies routinely evaluate the Company\u2019s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3M. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include financial strength, business and financial risk, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. 3M currently has an AA- credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard\u00a0& Poor\u2019s and has an A1 credit rating with a stable outlook from Moody\u2019s Investors Service. In March 2016, Moody\u2019s downgraded 3M\u2019s rating from Aa3 to A1, revised 3M\u2019s outlook from negative to stable, and affirmed the Company\u2019s short-term rating of P-1. This ratings action followed 3M\u2019s announcement of its new five-year plan for the period 2016 through 2020 in which the Company communicated its intent to further increase financial leverage. The Company\u2019s credit ratings have served to lower 3M\u2019s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders. The Company\u2019s ongoing transition to a better-optimized capital structure, financed with additional low-cost debt, could impact 3M\u2019s credit rating in the future. Failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings would adversely affect the Company\u2019s cost of funding and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\u00a0The Company\u2019s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences.\n\n Demand for the Company\u2019s products, which impacts revenue and profit margins, is affected by (i)\u00a0the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products; (ii)\u00a0the Company\u2019s response to downward pricing to stay competitive; (iii)\u00a0changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in the Company\u2019s incentive programs, or the customer\u2019s ability to achieve incentive goals; and (iv)\u00a0changes in customers\u2019 preferences for our products, including the success of products offered by our competitors, and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the Company\u2019s products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\u00a0Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company\u2019s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings. \n\nBecause the Company\u2019s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and approximately 60 percent of the Company\u2019s revenues are derived from outside the United States, the Company\u2019s results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the U.S. dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\u00a0The Company\u2019s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings, including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market.\n\n This ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as the inability to identify viable new products, obtain adequate intellectual property protection, or gain market acceptance of new products. There are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\u00a0The Company\u2019s future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components, compounds, raw materials and energy, including oil and natural gas and their derivatives, due to shortages, increased demand, supply interruptions, currency exchange risks, natural disasters and other factors.\n\n The Company depends on various components, compounds, raw materials, and energy (including oil and natural gas and their derivatives) supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products. It is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural and other disasters and other events, or be terminated in the future. Any sustained interruption in the Company\u2019s receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, while the Company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\u00a0Acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies, and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results. \n\nThe \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\nCompany monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures and changes to its organizational structure. With respect to acquisitions, future results will be affected by the Company\u2019s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\u00a0The Company\u2019s future results may be affected if the Company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated.\n\n The Company utilizes various tools, such as Lean Six Sigma, and engages in ongoing global business transformation. Business transformation is defined as changes in processes and internal/external service delivery across 3M to move to more efficient business models to improve operational efficiency and productivity, while allowing 3M to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency. This is enabled by the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis. There can be no assurance that all of the projected productivity improvements will be realized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\u00a0The Company employs information technology systems to support its business, including ongoing phased implementation of an ERP system as part of business transformation on a worldwide basis over the next several years. Security breaches and other disruptions to the Company\u2019s information technology infrastructure could interfere with the Company\u2019s operations, compromise information belonging to the Company and its customers, suppliers, and employees, exposing the Company to liability which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business and reputation. \n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company relies on information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. Additionally, the Company collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. Despite our cybersecurity measures (including employee and third-party training, monitoring of networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems) which are continuously reviewed and upgraded, the Company\u2019s information technology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, service providers including cloud services, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. It is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended period, up to and including several years. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats to the Company\u2019s information technology networks and infrastructure, none of them to date has had a material impact to the Company. There may be other challenges and risks as the Company upgrades and standardizes its ERP system on a worldwide basis. Any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. Although the Company maintains insurance coverage for various cybersecurity risks, there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\u00a0The Company's defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our results.\n\n The performance of financial markets and discount rates impact the Company's funding obligations under its defined benefit plans. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets, and relevant legislative or regulatory changes relating to defined benefit plan funding may increase the Company's funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\u00a0The Company\u2019s future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings and legal compliance risks, including those involving product liability, antitrust, intellectual property, environmental, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery, anti-corruption, or other matters.\n\n The outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the Company\u2019s expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to reliably predict. Various factors or developments can lead the Company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period.

These operational benefits were partially offset by the impact of flat organic sales and lower asset utilization. Restructuring actions resulted in an after-tax charge of 14 cents per diluted share in 2015, which provided a year-on-year benefit in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcquisition and divestiture impacts, which are measured for the first twelve months post-transaction, related to the acquisitions of Membrana and Capital Safety (third quarter 2015) and Semfinder (September 2016), and the divestitures of Polyfoam (first quarter 2016), the library systems business (fourth quarter 2015/first quarter 2016), and the license plate converting business in France (fourth quarter 2015). In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2016, 3M sold the assets of its protective films business and its cathode battery technology out-licensing business. On a combined basis, these acquisition/divestiture year-on-year impacts resulted in a 14 cents per diluted share benefit to earnings per share in 2016, driven by solid performances from 2015 acquisitions and year-on-year divestiture gains. Refer to Note 2 for further discussion of these acquisition/divestiture impacts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeign currency impacts (net of hedging) decreased pre-tax earnings by approximately $127 million year-on-year in 2016, excluding the impact of foreign currency changes on tax rates. This is equivalent to a year-on-year decrease of 14 cents per diluted share for 2016. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the past few years, 3M has taken actions to better optimize its capital structure and reduce its cost of capital by adding debt. These actions have led to an increase in interest expense year-on-year in 2016, largely due to higher average debt balances. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe income tax rate was 28.3 percent in 2016, a decline of 0.8 percentage points versus last year. The 2016 change in tax rate was driven by a number of factors as referenced in Note 8, including the first quarter 2016 adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-09 (discussed in Note 1). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeighted-average diluted shares outstanding in 2016 declined 3 percent versus last year, which benefited earnings per share. The benefits from share repurchases, net of issuances, were partially offset by the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, which increased the calculated number of diluted shares in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRefer to the section entitled \u201cResults of Operations\u201d for further discussion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear 2015 versus Year 2014 EPS:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor total year 2015, net income attributable to 3M was $4.833 billion, or $7.58 per diluted share, compared to $4.956 billion, or $7.49 per diluted share, in 2014, an increase of 1.2 percent on a per diluted share basis. Operational benefits include the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases, partially offset by higher pension/postretirement benefit costs. Restructuring actions (discussed in Note 4) resulted in an after-tax charge of 14 cents per diluted share. Acquisition and divestiture impacts primarily relate to the Capital Safety and Membrana acquisitions, and the divestitures of the license plate converting business in France and substantially all of the library systems business. Foreign exchange impacts decreased earnings per diluted share by approximately 43 cents year-on-year, driven by average year-on-year changes in foreign exchange rates in the Euro of 17 percent, Yen of 12 percent, and Brazil Real of 30 percent. The income tax rate was largely unchanged year-on-year. Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding in 2015 declined 3.7 percent year-on-year to 637.2 million, which increased earnings per diluted share by approximately 28 cents.

Sales declined slightly in oral care, as this business continued to be impacted by soft end-market conditions and channel inventory adjustments. Health information systems also declined due to a slower rate of software installations in a tougher market over the past year, along with a challenging comparison against last year\u2019s fourth quarter. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00b7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSales decreased 0.6 percent in Electronics and Energy. Electronics-related sales were flat, with growth in electronics materials solutions more than offset by a decline in display materials and systems. This was an improvement over recent quarters as end-market conditions and channel inventories became more stable. Energy-related sales declined 2 percent as growth in telecommunications markets was offset by declines in electrical markets, and renewable energy. In December 2015, 3M exited its backsheet business in renewable energy, which reduced energy-related organic sales by 3.5 percent year-on-year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00b7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSales decreased 0.7 percent in the Consumer business segment.

The year-on-year comparison related to 2015 restructuring charges increased operating income margins by 1.6 percentage points. In addition, lower pension/postretirement benefit costs, raw material cost decreases, year-on-year divestiture gains, and productivity benefits improved operating income margins.

in 2016 decreased 0.5 percent, impacted by foreign currency translation, which reduced sales by 1.2 percent. Organic local-currency sales growth (which includes organic volume and selling price impacts) declined 0.1 percent, acquisitions added 1.2 percent, and divestitures reduced sales by 0.4 percent. Sales in U.S. dollars increased in Safety and Graphics by 2.6 percent, Health Care by 2.0 percent, Consumer by 1.3 percent, and Industrial by 0.2 percent, while sales in Electronics and Energy declined 8.1 percent. All of 3M\u2019s five business segments posted operating income margins of more than 22 percent in 2016.

This new program has no pre-established end date. In 2016, the Company purchased $3.75 billion of its own stock, compared to purchases of more than $5 billion of its own stock each year in 2015 and 2014. The Company expects to purchase $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion of its own stock in 2017. In February\u00a02017, 3M\u2019s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2017 dividend of $1.175 per share, an increase of 6 percent. This marked the 59th consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M. 3M\u2019s debt to total capital ratio (total capital defined as debt plus equity) was 53 percent at December\u00a031, 2016, 48 percent at December\u00a031, 2015, and 35 percent at December\u00a031, 2014. The Company has an AA- credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard\u00a0& Poor\u2019s and an A1 credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Moody\u2019s Investors Service. The Company generates significant ongoing cash flow and has proven access to capital markets funding throughout business cycles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaw materials: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2016, the Company experienced declining costs for most raw material categories and transportation fuel, due largely to price decreases in crude oil and the derivative chemical feedstock markets. This in turn drove year-on-year cost decreases in many feedstock categories, including petroleum based materials, minerals, metals and wood pulp based products. To date the Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPension and postretirement defined benefit/contribution plans:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a worldwide basis, 3M\u2019s pension and postretirement plans were 84 percent funded at year-end 2016. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan, which is approximately 68 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 90 percent funded and the international pension plans were 85 percent funded. The U.S. non-qualified pension plan is not funded due to tax considerations and other factors. Asset returns in 2016 for the primary U.S. qualified pension plan were 5.8%, as 3M strategically invests in both growth assets and fixed income matching assets to manage its funded status. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2017 is 7.25%, down 0.25% from 2016. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan year-end 2016 discount rate was 4.21%, down 0.26 percentage points from the year-end 2015 discount rate of 4.47%. The decrease in U.S. discount rates resulted in an increased valuation of the projected benefit obligation (PBO). The plan\u2019s funded status decreased slightly in 2016 as the growth in the PBO increased at a greater rate than the plan assets returned in 2016. Additional detail and discussion of international plan asset returns and discount rates is provided in Note 11 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3M expects to contribute approximately $300 million to $500 million of cash to its global defined benefit pension and postretirement plans in 2017. The Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2017. 3M expects global defined benefit pension and postretirement expense in 2017 (before settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) to increase by approximately $74 million pre-tax when compared to 2016. Refer to \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates\u201d within MD&A and Note 11 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans) for additional information concerning 3M\u2019s pension and post-retirement plans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeginning on January 1, 2016, with respect to defined contribution plans, the Company reduced its match on employee 401(k)\u00a0contributions for U.S. employees. Previously, based on the date the employee was hired, up to 6% of eligible compensation was matched in cash at rates of 60%, 75% or 100%. Beginning in 2016, 5% of eligible compensation is matched at rates of 45%, 60% or 100%, respectively. The reduction in the company\u2019s match reduced 2016 defined contribution pension expense by approximately $30 million.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear 2017 announced divestitures:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn December 2016, 3M (Safety and Graphics Business) announced that it agreed to sell its identity management business.

The 2015 restructuring charges provided a favorable year-on-year comparison, in addition to productivity benefits in 2016 related to the 2015 restructuring actions. Acquisitions and divestitures, which are measured for the first twelve months post-transaction, had a favorable impact on operating margins. This included solid performances from both the Capital Safety and Membrana acquisitions (third quarter 2015). Divestiture impacts are related to the Polyfoam business (first quarter 2016), the library systems business (fourth quarter 2015/first quarter 2016), and the license plate converting business in France (fourth quarter 2015). In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2016, 3M sold the assets of its protective films business and its cathode battery technology out-licensing business. Items that reduced operating income margins included 2016 strategic investments, as 3M took actions to better optimize its manufacturing footprint and accelerated growth investments across its businesses. Foreign currency impacts (net of hedging) also reduced operating income margins. Organic volume declines and related utilization impacts included the impact of lower asset utilization, primarily in the Industrial, and Electronics and Energy businesses. The \u201clegal and other\u201d item in the preceding table related to an unfavorable second quarter 2016 arbitration ruling on an insurance claim, commercial litigation settlements related to Andover Healthcare and TransWeb, and accruals for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities (all of which are discussed in Note 14).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear 2015 versus Year 2014:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating income margins were 22.9 percent in 2015 compared to 22.4 percent in 2014, an increase of 0.5 percentage points.

The changes in noncontrolling interest amounts have largely related to Sumitomo 3M Limited (Japan), which was 3M\u2019s most significant consolidated entity with non-3M ownership interests. As discussed in Note 6, on September\u00a01, 2014, 3M purchased the remaining 25 percent ownership in Sumitomo 3M Limited, bringing 3M\u2019s ownership to 100 percent. Thus, effective September\u00a01, 2014, net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was significantly reduced. The primary remaining noncontrolling interest relates to 3M India Limited, of which 3M\u2019s effective ownership is 75 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrency Effects:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3M estimates that year-on-year currency effects, including hedging impacts, decreased pre-tax income by $127 million and $390 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. These estimates include the effect of translating profits from local currencies into U.S. dollars; the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3M operations in the United States and abroad; and transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks. 3M estimates that year-on-year derivative and other transaction gains and losses decreased pre-tax income by approximately $69 million in 2016 and increased pre-tax income by approximately $180 million in 2015.

As described in Note 16, \u00a0effective in the first quarter of 2016, 3M made a product line reporting change involving two of its business segments. Business segment information presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. 3M manages its operations in five business segments. The reportable segments are Industrial; Safety and Graphics; Electronics and Energy; Health Care; and Consumer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate and Unallocated:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to these five business segments, 3M assigns certain costs to \u201cCorporate and Unallocated,\u201d which is presented separately in the preceding business segments table and in Note 16. Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, such as corporate investment gains and losses, certain derivative gains and losses, certain insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and environmental expenses, corporate restructuring charges and certain under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension, stock-based compensation) that the Company determines not to allocate directly to its business segments. Because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate and Unallocated operating expenses decreased by $75 million in 2016 when compared to 2015. 3M\u2019s defined benefit pension and postretirement expense allocation to Corporate and Unallocated decreased by $223 million in 2016 when compared to 2015. In addition, the portion of the 2015 restructuring actions charged to corporate ($37 million) provided a favorable year-on-year comparison. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in legal expenses related to an unfavorable second quarter 2016 arbitration ruling on an insurance claim, commercial litigation settlements related to Andover Healthcare and TransWeb, and accruals for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities (all of which are discussed in Note 14). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate and Unallocated operating expenses increased by $105 million in 2015 when compared to 2014. This increase was driven by higher defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit expenses, which increased in total by $165 million. Of this increase, $153 million was allocated to Corporate and Unallocated. Increases were also driven by fourth quarter 2015 restructuring charges of $37 million, as indicated in the below table. Items which partially offset these increases within Corporate and Unallocated included higher administrative and R&D cost absorption by the five business segments, resulting in less under-absorbed expense being allocated to Corporate. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating Business Segments:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach of 3M\u2019s business segments incurred restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of 2015, as indicated in the following table. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestructuring Pre-Tax Charge by Business Segment:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Millions)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFourth Quarter 2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndustrial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n42\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSafety and Graphics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth Care\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectronics and Energy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsumer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate and Unallocated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n37\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n114\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation related to 3M\u2019s business segments is presented in the tables that follow.

Electronics and Energy segment serves customers in electronics and energy markets, including solutions that improve the dependability, cost-effectiveness, and performance of electronic devices; electrical products, including infrastructure protection; telecommunications networks; and power generation and distribution. This segment\u2019s electronics solutions include optical film solutions for the electronic display industry; high-performance fluids and abrasives; high-temperature and display tapes; flexible circuits, which use electronic packaging and interconnection technology; and touch systems products. This segment\u2019s energy solutions include pressure sensitive tapes and resins; electrical insulation; infrastructure products that provide both protection and detection solutions; a wide array of fiber-optic and copper-based telecommunications systems; and renewable energy component solutions for the solar and wind power industries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe display materials and systems business provides films that serve numerous market segments of the electronic display industry. 3M provides distinct products for five market segments, including products for: 1) LCD computer monitors 2) LCD televisions 3) handheld devices such as cellular phones and tablets 4) notebook PCs and 5) automotive displays. The display materials and systems business includes a number of different products that are protected by various patents and groups of patents. These patents provide varying levels of exclusivity to 3M for a number of such products. As some of 3M\u2019s multi-layer optical film patents expired at the end of 2013 and will expire over several years thereafter, 3M is seeing more competition in these products. 3M continues to innovate in the area of optical films and files patents on its new technology and products. 3M\u2019s proprietary manufacturing technology and know-how also provide a competitive advantage to 3M independent of its patents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear 2016 results:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectronics and Energy sales totaled $4.8 billion, down 8.1 percent in U.S. dollars.

Export sales are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3M customers are made. A portion of the products or components sold by 3M\u2019s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas. As customers move their operations from one geographic area to another, 3M\u2019s results will follow. Thus, net sales in a particular geographic area are not indicative of end-user consumption in that geographic area. Financial information related to 3M operations in various geographic areas is provided in Note 17.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

As stated in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings, the Company\u2019s pension and postretirement obligations, asset impairments and income taxes.

The primary U.S. defined-benefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\nJanuary\u00a01, 2009. The Company accounts for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 715, \n\nCompensation \u2014 Retirement Benefits\n\n, in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost. ASC 715 requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension or postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of stockholders\u2019 equity. While the company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. See Note\u00a011 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining defined benefit pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant\u2019s years of service, compensation, and age at retirement or termination. The benefit obligation represents the present value of the benefits that employees are entitled to in the future for services already rendered as of the measurement date. The Company measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting benefit payment cash flows for each future period and discounting these cash flows back to the December 31 measurement date, using the yields of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Historically, the single aggregated discount rate used for each plan\u2019s benefit obligation was also used for the calculation of all net periodic benefit costs, including the measurement of the service and interest costs. Beginning in 2016, 3M changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs. The new method measures service cost and interest cost separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. Service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income. The Company changed to the new method to provide a more precise measure of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the discrete spot yield curve rates. The Company accounted for this change as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing this methodology, the Company determined discount rates for its plans as follow:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Qualified Pension\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational Pension (weighted average)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Postretirement Medical\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 31, 2016 Liability:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenefit obligation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.21\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.54\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.08\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017 Net Periodic Benefit Cost Components:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService cost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.44\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.32\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.37\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest cost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.62\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.25\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.41\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother significant element in determining the Company\u2019s pension expense in accordance with ASC 715 is the expected return on plan assets, which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2017 is 7.25%, 0.25% lower than 2016. Refer to Note 11 for information on how the 2016 rate was determined. Return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions. The weighted average expected return for the international pension plan is 5.16% for 2017, compared to 5.77% for 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the year ended December\u00a031, 2016, the Company recognized total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense (after settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) of $251 million, down from $556\u00a0million in 2015.

Management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time. This includes the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses. These estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. For instance, expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the $2.3 billion in net identifiable intangible assets, $0.6 billion relates to indefinite-lived tradenames, primarily Capital Safety, whose tradenames ($520 million at acquisition date) have been in existence for over 55 years (refer to Note 2 for more detail). The primary valuation technique used in estimating the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets (tradenames) is a discounted cash flow approach. Specifically, a relief of royalty rate is applied to estimated sales, with the resulting amounts then discounted using an appropriate market/technology discount rate. The relief of royalty rate is the estimated royalty rate a market participant would pay to acquire the right to market/produce the product. If the resulting discounted cash flows are less than the book value of the indefinite lived intangible asset, impairment exists, and the asset value must be written down. Based on impairment testing in the third quarter of 2016, no impairment was indicated. The discounted cash flows related to the Capital Safety tradename exceeded its book value by more than 10 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3M goodwill totaled approximately $9.2 billion as of December\u00a031, 2016. 3M\u2019s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of each year. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. At 3M, reporting units correspond to a division. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit\u2019s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3M typically uses the price/earnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows. 3M uses the discounted cash flow approach for start-up, loss position and declining businesses, in addition to businesses where the price/earnings ratio valuation method indicates additional review is warranted. 3M also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs described in Note 16, effective in the first quarter of 2016, 3M made a product line reporting change involving two of its business segments. For any product moves that resulted in reporting unit changes, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed. The discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2016 annual impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n39\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of October\u00a01, 2016, 3M had 26 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 86 percent of the goodwill. These ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: Advanced Materials, Communication Markets, Display Materials and Systems, Health Information Systems,\u00a0Industrial Adhesives and Tapes,\u00a0Infection Prevention, Oral Care Solutions, Personal Safety (which includes the Capital Safety acquisition), Separation and Purification (which includes the Membrana acquisition), and Traffic Safety and Security. The estimated fair values for these reporting units were in excess of carrying value by approximately 35 percent or more, except for one reporting unit with approximately $250 million of goodwill, where the fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately 30 percent. 3M\u2019s market value at both December 31, 2016, and September 30, 2016, was significantly in excess of its shareholders\u2019 equity of approximately $10 billion and $12 billion, at December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2016, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2016, 3M primarily used an industry price-earnings ratio approach, but also used a discounted cash flows approach for certain reporting units, to determine fair values. Where applicable, 3M used a weighted-average discounted cash flow analysis for certain divisions, using projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions, among other factors. The weighting was based on management\u2019s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3M is an integrated materials enterprise, thus many of 3M\u2019s businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3M\u2019s focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3M\u2019s value being comprised of internally developed businesses that have no goodwill associated with them. Based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2016, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactors which could result in future impairment charges include, among others, changes in worldwide economic conditions, changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These risk factors are discussed in Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d of this document. In addition, changes in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing results. As indicated above, during the first quarter of 2016, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by changes between reporting units and determined that no impairment existed. Long-lived assets with a definite life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. If future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3M would expect that only a portion of the long-lived assets or goodwill would be impaired. 3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2017 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome Taxes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe extent of 3M\u2019s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The Company follows guidance provided by ASC 740,\u00a0\n\nIncome Taxes\n\n, regarding uncertainty in income taxes, to record these liabilities (refer to Note 8 for additional information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company\u2019s current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the Company\u2019s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEM\n\nENTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, \n\nImprovements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\n\n, which modifies certain accounting aspects for share-based payments to employees including, among other elements, the accounting for income taxes and forfeitures, as well as classifications in the statement of cash flows.

Investing in 3M\u2019s businesses to drive organic growth remains the first priority for capital deployment, including research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability.\u00a0Investment in organic growth will be supplemented by complementary acquisitions. 3M will also continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\u00a0Sources for cash availability in the United States, such as ongoing cash flow from operations and access to capital markets, have historically been sufficient to fund dividend payments to shareholders and share repurchases, as well as funding U.S. acquisitions and other items as needed. For those international earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. However, if these international funds are needed for operations in the U.S., 3M would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate them. See Note 8 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3M\u2019s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3M\u2019s commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. Effective July 15, 2016, this program was increased to a maximum of $5 billion outstanding from a previous program size of $3 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Debt:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe strength of 3M\u2019s capital structure and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company\u2019s maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. 3M currently has an AA- credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard\u00a0& Poor\u2019s and has an A1 credit rating with a stable outlook from Moody\u2019s Investors Service. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company has a \u201cwell-known seasoned issuer\u201d (WKSI) shelf registration statement, effective May 16, 2014, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities for future sales. In May 2016, in connection with the WKSI shelf, 3M entered into an amended and restated distribution agreement relating to the future issuance and sale (from time to time) of the Company\u2019s medium-term notes program (Series F), up to the aggregate principal amount of $18 billion, which was an increase from the previous aggregate principal amount up to $9 billion of the same Series. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s total debt was $853 million higher at December 31, 2016 when compared to December\u00a031, 2015, with the increase primarily due to May 2016 and September 2016 debt issuances, partially offset by the September 2016 repayment of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. In May 2016, 3M issued 500 million Euro aggregate principal amount of 5.75-year fixed rate medium-term notes due February 2022 with a coupon rate of 0.375% and 500 million Euro aggregate principal amount of 15-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2031 with a coupon rate of 1.50%. In September 2016, 3M issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of five-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2021 with a coupon rate of 1.625%, $650 million aggregate principal amount of 10-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2026 with a coupon rate of 2.250%, and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 30-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2046 with a coupon rate of 3.125%. All of these 2016 issuances were under the medium-term notes program (Series F). As of December 31, 2016, the total amount of debt issued as part of the medium-term notes program (Series F), inclusive of debt issued in 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015 and the 2016 debt referenced above, is approximately $11.1 billion (utilizing the foreign exchange rates applicable at the time of issuance for the Euro \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n41\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\ndenominated debt).

This credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to $1.25 billion (at lenders\u2019 discretion), bringing the total facility up to $5.0 billion. This revolving credit facility is undrawn at December 31, 2016. Under the $3.75 billion credit agreement, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2016, this ratio was approximately 44 to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends. Apart from the committed facilities, an additional $291 million in stand-alone letters of credit and bank guarantees were also issued and outstanding at December 31, 2016. These instruments are utilized in connection with normal business activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt December 31, 2016, 3M had $2.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $2.35 billion was held by the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries and approximately $350 million was held by the United States. These balances are invested in bank instruments and other high-quality fixed income securities. At December\u00a031, 2015, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries and by the United States totaled approximately $1.7 billion and $200 million, respectively.

These measures include accounts receivable turns (defined as quarterly net sales multiplied by 4 divided by ending accounts receivable \u2013 net) and inventory turns (defined as quarterly manufacturing cost multiplied by 4 divided by ending inventory). For inventory turns calculation purposes, manufacturing cost is defined as cost of sales less freight and engineering costs.

flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as pension funding decisions, tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2016, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $242 million compared to the same period last year, with this increase primarily due to lower year-on-year cash taxes and higher net income. These items were partially offset by higher Company pension contributions. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by $108 million in 2016, compared to working capital increases of $46 million in 2015. Additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the \u201cFinancial Condition and Liquidity\u201d section. Information concerning defined benefit pension and postretirement contributions and expense is provided in Note 11, with additional discussion in the preceding Results of Operations section. Other-net in the preceding table reflects a reduction in cash flows from operating activities, partially due to divestiture gains in 2016 (discussed in Note 2), as cash divestiture activity is presented as proceeds from sale of businesses within investing activities, not operating activities. Additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the \u201cFinancial Condition and Liquidity\u201d section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2015, cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $206 million compared to 2014. Operating cash flows decreased due to $363 million in higher cash income taxes when comparing 2015 to 2014, plus lower net income, which was partially offset by lower year-on-year working capital requirements. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by $46 million in 2015, compared to increases of $306 million in 2014, with the year-on-year improvement related to lower organic volume growth. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of

In February\u00a02016, 3M\u2019s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M\u2019s outstanding common stock, which replaced the Company\u2019s February\u00a02014 repurchase program. This authorization has no pre-established end date. In 2016, the Company purchased $3.75 billion of its own stock, compared to purchases in 2015 and 2014 of more than $5 billion of its own stock in each year. The Company expects full-year 2017 gross share repurchases will be in the range of $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion.

Free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, they should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. 3M defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment (which is classified as an investing activity).

Interest projections on both floating and fixed rate long-term debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, are based on effective interest rates as of December\u00a031, 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the Company.

Many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3M guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers. The Company expects to receive consideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. Contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table, but these commitments represent a small part of the Company\u2019s expected capital spending. The purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which the Company is contractually obligated. The majority of 3M\u2019s products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional commitment. For this reason, these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the Company\u2019s expected future cash outflows on a stand-alone basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther obligations, included in the preceding table within the caption entitled \u201cUnconditional purchase obligations and other,\u201d include the current portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under ASC 740, which is expected to be paid out in cash in the next 12 months. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time; therefore, the long-term portion of the net tax liability of $284 million is excluded from the preceding table.

Changes in those factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows. Senior management provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities, determines certain of the Company\u2019s financial risk policies and objectives, and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization. Senior management also establishes certain associated procedures relative to control and valuation, risk analysis, counterparty credit approval, and ongoing monitoring and reporting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity price swaps, and forward and option contracts. However, the Company\u2019s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties.

These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. 3M may dedesignate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction. Beginning in the second quarter of 2014, 3M began extending the maximum length of time over which it hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions from a previous term of 12 months to a longer term of 24 months, with certain currencies being extended further to 36 months starting in the first quarter of 2015. In addition, 3M enters into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset, in part, the impacts of certain intercompany activities (primarily associated with intercompany licensing arrangements and intercompany financing transactions). As circumstances warrant, the Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency denominated debt as hedging instruments to hedge portions of the Company\u2019s net investments in foreign operations. The dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the Company\u2019s foreign exchange forward and option contracts designated as cash flow hedges and those not designated as hedging instruments were $3.2 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively, at December\u00a031, 2016. As of December\u00a031, 2016, the Company had 150 million Euros and 248 billion South Korean Won in notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts designated as net investment hedges along with 4.4 billion Euros in principal amount of foreign currency denominated debt designated as non-derivative hedging instruments in certain net investment hedges as discussed in Note 12 in the \u201cNet Investment Hedges\u201d section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest Rates Risk:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company may be impacted by interest rate volatility with respect to existing debt and future debt issuances. 3M manages interest rate risk and expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. In addition, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The dollar equivalent (based on inception date foreign currency exchange rates) gross notional amount of the Company\u2019s interest rate swaps at December\u00a031, 2016 was $2.0 billion.

The related mark-to-market gain or loss on qualifying hedges was included in other comprehensive income to the extent effective, and reclassified into cost of sales in the period during which the hedged transaction affected earnings. The Company may enter into other commodity price swaps to offset, in part, fluctuation and costs associated with the use of certain commodities and precious metals.

A Monte Carlo simulation technique was used to test the impact on after-tax earnings related to financial instruments (primarily debt), derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at December\u00a031, 2016. The model (third-party bank dataset) used a 95 percent confidence level over a 12-month time horizon. The exposure to changes in currency rates model used 18 currencies, interest rates related to three currencies, and commodity prices related to five commodities. This model does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the Company. This model does not include certain hedge transactions, because the Company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results.

This estimate includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies into U.S. dollars; the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3M operations in the United States and abroad; and transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks. 3M estimates that year-on-year derivative and other transaction gains and losses had the following effects on pre-tax income: 2016 ($69 million decrease) and 2015 ($180 million increase).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn analysis of the global exposures related to purchased components and materials is performed at each year-end.

The Company\u2019s business is subject to global competition and geopolitical risks and may be adversely affected by factors in the United States and other countries that are beyond its control, such as slower economic growth, disruptions in financial markets, economic downturns in the form of either contained or widespread recessionary conditions, inflation, elevated unemployment levels, sluggish or uneven recovery, government actions impacting international trade agreements, imposing trade restrictions such as tariffs, and retaliatory counter measures, government deficit reduction and other austerity measures in specific countries or regions, or in the various industries in which the Company operates; social, political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions; natural and other disasters or climate change affecting the operations of the Company or its customers and suppliers; or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital, interest rates, tax rates, tax laws, or exchange control, ability to expatriate earnings and other regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\u00a0Change in the Company\u2019s credit ratings could increase cost of funding.\n\n The Company\u2019s credit ratings are important to 3M\u2019s cost of capital. The major rating agencies routinely evaluate the Company\u2019s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3M. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include financial strength, business and financial risk, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. 3M currently has an AA- credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard\u00a0& Poor\u2019s and has an A1 credit rating with a stable outlook from Moody\u2019s Investors Service. The Company\u2019s credit ratings have served to lower 3M\u2019s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders. The addition of further leverage to the Company\u2019s capital structure could impact 3M\u2019s credit ratings in the future. Failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings would adversely affect the Company\u2019s cost of funding and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\u00a0The Company\u2019s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences.\n\n Demand for the Company\u2019s products, which impacts revenue and profit margins, is affected by (i)\u00a0the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products; (ii)\u00a0the Company\u2019s response to downward pricing to stay competitive; (iii)\u00a0changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in the Company\u2019s incentive programs, or the customer\u2019s ability to achieve incentive goals; (iv)\u00a0changes in customers\u2019 preferences for our products, including the success of products offered by our competitors, and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the Company\u2019s products; and (v) changes in the business environment related to disruptive technologies, such as artificial intelligence, block-chain, expanded analytics and other enhanced learnings from increasing volume of available data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\u00a0Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company\u2019s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings. \n\nBecause the Company\u2019s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and approximately 60 percent of the Company\u2019s revenues are derived from outside the United States, the Company\u2019s results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the U.S. dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\u00a0The Company\u2019s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings, including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market.\n\n This ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as the inability to identify viable new products, obtain adequate intellectual property protection, or gain market acceptance of new products.

It is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural and other disasters and other events, or be terminated in the future. Any sustained interruption in the Company\u2019s receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, while the Company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\u00a0Acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies, and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results. \n\nThe Company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures and changes to its organizational structure. With respect to acquisitions, future results will be affected by the Company\u2019s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\u00a0The Company\u2019s future results may be affected if the Company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated.\n\n The Company utilizes various tools, such as Lean Six Sigma, and engages in ongoing global business transformation. Business transformation is defined as changes in processes and internal/external service delivery across 3M to move to more efficient business models to improve operational efficiency and productivity, while allowing 3M to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency. This is enabled by the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis. There can be no assurance that all of the projected productivity improvements will be realized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\u00a0The Company employs information technology systems to support its business, including ongoing phased implementation of an ERP system as part of business transformation on a worldwide basis over the next several years. Security breaches and other disruptions to the Company\u2019s information technology infrastructure could interfere with the Company\u2019s operations, compromise information belonging to the Company or its customers, suppliers, and employees, exposing the Company to liability which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business and reputation. \n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company relies on centralized and local information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of businesses. Additionally, the Company collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. Despite our cybersecurity measures (including employee and third-party training, monitoring of networks and systems, patching, maintenance, and backup of systems and data), the Company\u2019s information technology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers, breaches, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, computer viruses, ransomware, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, service or cloud provider breaches, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. It is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended period, up to and including several years. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of vulnerabilities to the Company\u2019s information technology networks and infrastructure, none of them to date has had a material impact to the Company. There may be other challenges and risks as the Company upgrades and standardizes its ERP system on a worldwide basis. Any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruptions or shutdowns, and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. Although the Company maintains insurance coverage for various cybersecurity and business continuity risks, there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\u00a0The Company's defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our results.\n\n The performance of financial markets and discount rates impact the Company's funding obligations under its defined benefit plans.

Various factors or developments can lead the Company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period.

Both divestitures were reported within the Company\u2019s Electronics and Energy business. \u00a0During the second quarter and fourth quarter of 2018, management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions related to addressing corporate functional costs following the Communication Markets Division divestiture. These actions affected approximately 1,200 positions worldwide and resulted in a second quarter 2018 pre-tax charge of $105 million and a fourth quarter 2018 pre-tax charge of $22 million, net of adjustments for reductions in cost estimates.

The net impact related to Scott Safety included income from operations, more than offset by the transaction and integration costs of the acquisition. Interest expense related to financing costs of Scott Safety are also included. The net impact related to Scott Safety was equivalent to a year-on-year decrease of 7 cents per diluted share. Full year 2017 had year-on-year operating income impacts from the following divestitures: Polyfoam and the remaining portion of the library system business (both in first quarter 2016), protective films business and cathode battery technology out-license business (both in fourth quarter 2016), prescription safety eyewear business (January 2017), tolling and automated license/number plate recognition business (second quarter of 2017), and electronic monitoring business (fourth quarter 2017).

The effective tax rate was 35.5 percent, an increase of 7.2 percentage points versus 2016. Excluding the impact of TCJA, the effective income tax rate was 25.4 percent in the full year 2017, a decrease of 2.9 percentage points versus 2016.

Under the terms of the settlement, 3M agreed to provide an $850 million grant to the State for a special \u201c3M Water Quality and Sustainability Fund.\u201d This Fund will enable projects that support water sustainability in the Twin Cities East Metro region, such as continued delivery of water to residents and enhancing groundwater recharge to support sustainable growth. The projects will also result in habitat and recreation improvements, such as fishing piers, trails, and open space preservation.\u00a03M recorded a charge of $897 million ($710 million after-tax), inclusive of legal fees and other related obligations, in the first quarter of 2018 associated with the resolution of this matter. In the fourth quarter of 2018, 3M recorded a related $60 million tax expense resulting from the Company\u2019s ongoing IRS examination under the Compliance Assurance Process (CAP) and new guidance released under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Also during the first quarter of 2018, 3M recorded a tax expense of $217 million related to a measurement period adjustment to the provisional amounts recorded in December 2017 from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). In the fourth quarter 2018, 3M finalized the tax impact related to TCJA with a reversal of previously recorded tax expense in the amount of $41 million.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, 3M recorded a net tax expense of $762 million related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The expense was primarily related to the TCJA\u2019s transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and was net of remeasurement of 3M\u2019s deferred tax assets and liabilities considering the TCJA\u2019s newly enacted tax rates and certain other impacts. This provisional amount was subject to adjustment during the measurement period of up to one year following the December 2017 enactment of the TCJA, as provided by SEC guidance.\n\nIn addition to providing financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company also provides non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impacts of the NRD resolution and enactment/measurement period adjustments to the impact of the enactment of the TCJA. These items represent significant charges/benefits that impacted the Company\u2019s financial results. Operating income, operating income margin, effective tax rate, net income, and earnings per share are all measures for which 3M provides the GAAP measure and an adjusted measure. The adjusted measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP measures. The Company considers these non-GAAP measures in evaluating and managing the Company\u2019s operations.

Operating income margins were 21.2 percent, up 1.6 percentage points, with 1.2 percentage points of this increase driven by benefits from expenses related to portfolio and footprint actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2017 that were not repeated in the fourth quarter of 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00b7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Safety and Graphics, total sales increased 0.3 percent, or 3.3 percent on an organic local currency basis. Organic sales increased in personal safety and commercial solutions while organic sales declined in transportation safety and roofing granules. Operating income margins were 22.0 percent, down 3.9 percentage points, with 2.8 percentage points of this decrease driven by year-on-year impact of 2017 divestiture gains, partially offset by acquisitions and portfolio and footprint actions that were not repeated in 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00b7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Health Care, total sales increased 2.4 percent, or 4.8 percent on an organic local currency sales basis.

Latin America/Canada and EMEA had price growth, while the U.S. selling prices declined slightly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial condition: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3M generated $6.4 billion of operating cash flow in 2018, an increase of $199 million when compared to 2017. This followed a decrease of $422 million when comparing 2017 to 2016. Refer to the section entitled \u201cFinancial Condition and Liquidity\u201d later in MD&A for a discussion of items impacting cash flows. In November\u00a02018, 3M\u2019s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M\u2019s outstanding common stock, which replaced the Company\u2019s February 2016 repurchase program. This program has no pre-established end date. In 2018, the Company purchased $4.9 billion of its own stock, compared to purchases of $2.1 billion in 2017 and $3.8 billion in 2016. The Company expects to purchase $2.0 billion to $4.0 billion of its own stock in 2019. In February\u00a02019, 3M\u2019s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2019 dividend of $1.44 per share, an increase of 6 percent. This marked the 61st consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M. The Company has an AA- credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard\u00a0& Poor\u2019s and an A1 credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Moody\u2019s Investors Service. The Company generates significant ongoing cash flow and has proven access to capital markets funding throughout business cycles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaw materials:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2018, the Company experienced raw material price inflation across most material markets worldwide. In response, the Company continued to deploy productivity projects to minimize the impact of raw material inflation and market supply challenges, including input management, reformulations, and multi-sourcing activities. These succeeded in partially offsetting the overall raw material headwinds experienced throughout the year. To date, the Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is difficult to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories, strategic relationships with key suppliers, and development and qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPension and postretirement defined benefit/contribution plans:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a worldwide basis, 3M\u2019s pension and postretirement plans were 89 percent funded at year-end 2018. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan, which is approximately 67 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 96 percent funded and the international pension plans were 89 percent funded. The U.S. non-qualified pension plan is not funded due to tax considerations and other factors. Asset returns in 2018 for the primary U.S. qualified pension plan were -0.5%, as 3M strategically invests in both growth assets and fixed income matching assets to manage its funded status. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2019 is 7.00%. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan year-end 2018 discount rate was 4.36%, up 0.68 percentage points from the year-end 2017 discount rate of 3.68%. The increase in U.S. discount rates resulted in a decrease valuation of the projected benefit obligation (PBO). The primary U.S. qualified pension plan\u2019s funded status increased 2 percentage points in 2018 due to the lower PBO resulting from the significant discount rate increase and a $200 million contribution to the plan. Additional detail and discussion of international plan asset returns and discount rates is provided in Note 13 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3M expects to contribute approximately $100 million to $200 million of cash to its global defined benefit pension and postretirement plans in 2019. The Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2019. 3M expects global defined benefit pension and postretirement expense in 2019 (before settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) to decrease by approximately $130 million pre-tax when compared to 2018.

A number of factors impact the various income statement line items, such as raw material cost management, portfolio and footprint actions, divestitures, foreign currency, cost management, and pension and postretirement service cost effects. Expanded discussion of each of the income statement line items follows in the various sections below. Pension and postretirement service cost expense is recorded in cost of sales; selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A); and research, development and related expenses (R&D). In total, 3M\u2019s defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense increased $21 million in 2018, compared to an increase of $16 million in 2017. Refer to Note 13 (Pension and Postretirement Plans) for the service cost components of net periodic benefit costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company is investing in an initiative called business transformation, with these investments impacting cost of sales, SG&A, and R&D. Business transformation encompasses the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis, as well as changes in processes and internal/external service delivery across 3M.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost of Sales:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost of sales includes manufacturing, engineering and freight costs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost of sales, measured as a percent of sales, increased during 2018 primarily due to foreign currency effects (net of hedge losses). Additionally, cost of sales for full year 2018 were increased by the second quarter 2018 and fourth quarter 2018 Communication Markets Division related restructuring charges as discussed in Note 5. This increase was partially offset by 2017 portfolio and supply chain footprint optimization charges that did not repeat in 2018, and selling price increases. Selling prices increased net sales year-on-year by 1.1 percent for full year 2018. These were partially offset by raw material cost increases and higher defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense and defined contribution expense. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost of sales as a percent of sales increased during 2017 due to incremental strategic investments in productivity, portfolio actions and footprint optimization, foreign currency effects (net of hedge impacts) and higher defined benefit pension expense. This was partially offset by a year-on-year reduction in raw material input costs as a result of sourcing cost reduction projects. Selling prices were flat year-on-year for the full year 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSG&A in dollars increased 14.7 percent for full year 2018 when compared to the same period last year. The increase is primarily associated with the Communication Markets Division-related restructuring charges (as discussed in Note 5) and the charge related to the Minnesota NRD resolution (as discussed earlier in the \u201c\n\nOperating income, operating income margin, income before taxes, net income, earnings per share, and effective tax rate adjusted for impacts of the Minnesota NRD resolution and the measurement period adjustment to the impact of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) -\u00a0(non-GAAP measures)\n\n\u201d section and further in Note 16).

The decrease primarily relates to R&D no longer incurred related to the Communication Markets Division, which was primarily divested in the second quarter of 2018 and completed in the fourth quarter of 2018. 3M continued to invest in its key initiatives, including R&D aimed at disruptive innovation programs with the potential to create entirely new markets and disrupt existing markets. R&D, measured as a percent of sales, was 5.6 percent in 2018, compared to 5.9 percent in 2017 and 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGain on Sale of Businesses:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the first quarter of 2018, 3M closed on the sale of certain personal safety product offerings primarily focused on noise, environmental, and heat stress monitoring. In addition, 3M divested a polymer additives compounding business, formerly part of the Company\u2019s Industrial business, and reflected a gain on final closing adjustments from a prior divestiture which, in aggregate, were not material. These divestitures resulted in a gain on sale of businesses of $24 million. 3M also divested an abrasives glass products business, formerly part of the Company\u2019s Industrial business, which resulted in a gain on sale of less than $15 million in the second quarter of 2018. Also, 3M reflected an immaterial gain from an earnout on a previous divestiture in the fourth quarter of 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn June 2018, 3M completed the sale of substantially all of its Communication Markets Division to Corning Incorporated. This business, with annual sales of approximately $400 million, consists of optical fiber and copper passive connectivity solutions for the telecommunications industry including 3M\u2019s xDSL, FTTx, and structured cabling solutions and, in certain countries, telecommunications system integration services. This divestiture resulted in a gain on sale of $494 million. In December 2018, the Company completed the sale of the remaining telecommunications system integration services portion of the business based in Germany, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $15 million. Both the June 2018 and December 2018 divestiture impacts were reported within the Company\u2019s Electronics and Energy business. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRefer to Note 3 for additional detail on these divestitures. 3M also divested certain businesses in 2017 and 2016, resulting in gains of $586 million and $111 million, respectively.

The changes in the tax rates between years were impacted by many factors, including the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in December 2017 as further described in the Overview, \u201c\n\nIncome, earnings per share, and effective tax rate adjusted for impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) -(non-GAAP measures)\u201d \n\nsection and in Note 10. During the fourth quarter of 2017, 3M recorded a net tax expense of $762 million related to the enactment of the TCJA. As a result of finalizing estimates related to TCJA, the Company recorded additional net charges in the amount of $176 million as measurement period adjustments in 2018. The expense is primarily related to the TCJA\u2019s transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and is net of remeasurement of 3M\u2019s deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe TCJA establishes new tax laws that affected 2018 and will affect future periods, including, but not limited to: 1) reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, 2) the creation of a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI), 3) addition of provisions incentivizing foreign-derived intangible income (FDII), 4) significant change to the U.S. federal tax implications of dividends, 5) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation, and 6) the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction. Considering the impacts of the TCJA and other factors, the Company currently estimates its effective tax rate for 2019 will be approximately 20 to 22 percent. The tax rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete items, such as the settlement of income tax audits, changes in tax laws, and employee share-based payment accounting; as well as recurring factors, such as the geographic mix of income before taxes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRefer to Note 10 for further discussion of income taxes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Millions)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the elimination of the income or loss attributable to non-3M ownership interests in 3M consolidated entities.

Financial information and other disclosures are provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective in the first quarter of 2018, as part of 3M\u2019s continuing effort to improve the alignment of its businesses around markets and customers, the Company made the following changes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsolidation of customer account activity within international countries \u2013 expanding dual credit reporting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00b7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company consolidated its customer account activity in each country into centralized sales districts for certain countries that make up approximately 70 percent of 3M\u2019s 2017 international net sales. Expansion of these initiatives, which previously had been deployed only in the U.S., reduces the complexity for customers when interacting with multiple 3M businesses. 3M business segment reporting measures include dual credit to business segments for certain sales and related operating income. This dual credit is based on which business segment provides customer account activity with respect to a particular product sold in a specific country. The expansion of alignment of customer accounts within additional countries increased the attribution of dual credit across 3M\u2019s business segments. Additionally, certain sales and operating income results for electronic bonding product lines that were previously equally divided between the Electronics and Energy business segment and the Industrial business segment are now reported similarly to dual credit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCentralization of manufacturing and supply technology platforms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00b7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCertain shared film manufacturing and supply technology platform resources formerly reflected within the Electronics and Energy business segment were combined with other shared and centrally managed material resource centers of expertise within Corporate and Unallocated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, as discussed in Note 1, 3M adopted ASU No. 2017-07, \n\nImproving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost\n\n, effective January 1, 2018 on a retrospective basis. As a result, operating income for 3M\u2019s business segments has been revised to reflect non-service components of pension and postretirement net periodic benefit costs within other expense (income), net.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness segment information presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. 3M manages its operations in five business segments.

Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, such as corporate investment gains and losses, certain derivative gains and losses, certain insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and environmental expenses, corporate restructuring charges and certain under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension, stock-based compensation) that the Company determines not to allocate directly to its business segments. Corporate and Unallocated also includes sales, costs, and income from contract manufacturing, transition services and other arrangements with the acquirer of the Communication Markets Division following its divestiture in 2018. Because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate and Unallocated operating expenses increased by $1.1 billion in full year 2018 when compared to full year 2017. Beginning in the second quarter of 2018, the operating income from contractual manufacturing and other arrangements described in the paragraph above were included in Corporate and Unallocated. In addition, in the second quarter and fourth quarter of 2018, operating expenses included the restructuring charge of $105 million and $22 million, net of adjustments for reductions in cost estimates, respectively, as discussed in Note 5 related to addressing corporate functional costs following the Communication Markets Division divestiture.

In both the first and second quarters of 2017, a portion of the severance actions were reflected in Corporate and Unallocated. In the fourth quarter, an incremental $58 million was reflected within Corporate and Unallocated related to the Company\u2019s actuarial adjustments to its respirator mask/asbestos liability accrual. In addition, 3M\u2019s defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense allocation to Corporate and Unallocated increased by approximately $30 million in 2017.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating Business Segments:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation related to 3M\u2019s business segments is presented in the tables that follow.

Export sales are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3M customers are made. A portion of the products or components sold by 3M\u2019s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas. As customers move their operations from one geographic area to another, 3M\u2019s results will follow. Thus, net sales in a particular geographic area are not indicative of end-user consumption in that geographic area.

manufacturing efficiency. In 2018, 63% of 3M\u2019s capital spending was within the United States, followed by Europe, Middle East and Africa; Asia Pacific; and Latin America/Canada. 3M is increasing its investment in manufacturing and sourcing capability in order to more closely align its product capability with its sales in major geographic areas in order to best serve its customers throughout the world with proprietary, automated, efficient, safe and sustainable processes. Capital spending is discussed in more detail later in MD&A in the section entitled \u201cCash Flows from Investing Activities.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMA\n\nTES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation regarding significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements. As stated in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.

The primary U.S. defined-benefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective January\u00a01, 2009. The Company accounts for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 715, \n\nCompensation \u2014 Retirement Benefits\n\n, in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost. ASC 715 requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension or postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of stockholders\u2019 equity.

The benefit obligation represents the present value of the benefits that employees are entitled to in the future for services already rendered as of the measurement date. The Company measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting benefit payment cash flows for each future period and discounting these cash flows back to the December 31 measurement date, using the yields of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Service cost and interest cost are measured separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. Service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing this methodology, the Company determined discount rates for its plans as follow:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Qualified Pension\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational Pension (weighted average)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Postretirement Medical\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 31, 2018 Liability:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenefit obligation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 4.36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 2.50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 4.28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2019 Net Periodic Benefit Cost Components:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService cost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 4.47\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 2.36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 4.45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest cost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 4.04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 2.26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 3.93\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother significant element in determining the Company\u2019s pension expense in accordance with ASC 715 is the expected return on plan assets, which is based on strategic asset allocation of the plan, long-term capital market return expectations, and expected performance from active investment management. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2019 is 7.00%, a decrease from 7.25% in 2018. Refer to Note 13 for information on how the 2018 rate was determined. Return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions. The weighted average expected return for the international pension plan is 4.90% for 2019, compared to 5.02% for 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the year ended December\u00a031, 2018, the Company recognized consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement service cost expense of $483 million and a benefit of $73 million related to all non-service pension and postretirement net benefit costs (after settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) for a total \n\nconsolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of $410 million, up from $334\u00a0million in 2017. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2019, defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense is anticipated to total approximately $420 million while non-service pension and postretirement net benefit costs (before settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) is anticipated to be a benefit of approximately $140 million, for a total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of $280 million, a decrease of approximately $130 million compared to 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table below summarizes the impact on 2019 pension expense for the U.S. and international pension plans of a 0.25 percentage point increase/decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions used to measure plan liabilities and 2018 net periodic benefit cost.

Management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time. This includes the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses. These estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. For instance, expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the $2.7 billion in net identifiable intangible assets, $0.6 billion relates to indefinite-lived tradenames, primarily Capital Safety, whose tradenames ($520 million at acquisition date) have been in existence for over 55 years (refer to Note 4 for more detail). The primary valuation technique used in estimating the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets (tradenames) is a discounted cash flow approach. Specifically, a relief of royalty rate is applied to estimated sales, with the resulting amounts then discounted using an appropriate market/technology discount rate. The relief of royalty rate is the estimated royalty rate a market participant would pay to acquire the right to market/produce the product. If the resulting discounted cash flows are less than the book value of the indefinite lived intangible asset, impairment exists, and the asset value must be written down. Based on impairment testing in the third quarter of 2018, no impairment was indicated. The discounted cash flows related to the Capital Safety tradenames exceeded its book value by more than 20 percent in aggregate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3M goodwill totaled approximately $10.1 billion as of December\u00a031, 2018. 3M\u2019s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of each year. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but are required to be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. At 3M, reporting units correspond to a division. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit\u2019s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, and the loss would equal that difference. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3M typically uses the price/earnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows. 3M uses the discounted cash flow approach for start-up, loss position and declining businesses, in addition to using for businesses where the price/earnings ratio valuation method indicates additional review is warranted. 3M also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs described in Note 18, effective in the first quarter of 2018, 3M made business segment reporting changes. For any product moves that resulted in reporting unit changes, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed. The discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2018 annual impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of October\u00a01, 2018, 3M had 24 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 89 percent of the goodwill. These ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: Advanced Materials, Display Materials and Systems, Electronics Materials Solutions, Health Information Systems,\u00a0Industrial Adhesives and Tapes,\u00a0Infection Prevention, Oral Care Solutions, Personal Safety, Separation and Purification, and Transportation Safety. The estimated fair value for all reporting units was in excess of carrying value by approximately 79 percent or more. 3M\u2019s market value at both December 31, 2018, and September 30, 2018, was significantly in excess of its shareholders\u2019 equity of approximately $10 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs discussed in Note 3, 3M sold its Communication Markets division in 2018, which comprised substantially all of the $272 million reduction in goodwill associated with divestitures during 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2018, 3M determined fair values using either an industry price-earnings ratio approach or a discounted cash flows analysis.

These risk factors are discussed in Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d of this document. In addition, changes in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing results. As indicated above, during the first quarter of 2018, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by changes between reporting units and determined that no impairment existed. Long-lived assets with a definite life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. If future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3M would expect that only a portion of the long-lived assets or goodwill would be impaired. 3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2019 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome Taxes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe extent of 3M\u2019s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The Company follows guidance provided by ASC 740,\u00a0\n\nIncome Taxes\n\n, regarding uncertainty in income taxes, to record these liabilities (refer to Note 10 for additional information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company\u2019s current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the Company\u2019s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting in the fourth quarter of 2017 and continuing into 2018, 3M recorded a net tax expense related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The expense is primarily related to the TCJA\u2019s transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and remeasurement of 3M\u2019s deferred tax assets and liabilities. As discussed in Note 10, this expense was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEM\n\nENTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDI\n\nTY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe strength and stability of 3M\u2019s business model and strong free cash flow capability, together with proven capital markets access, positions the Company to be able to add further leverage to its capital structure. Investing in 3M\u2019s businesses to drive organic growth remains the first priority for capital deployment, including research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. Investment in organic growth will be supplemented by complementary acquisitions. 3M will also continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Sources for cash availability in the United States, such as ongoing cash flow from operations and access to capital markets, have historically been sufficient to fund dividend payments to shareholders, as well as funding U.S. acquisitions and other items as needed. The TCJA creates additional repatriation opportunities for 3M to access international cash positions on a continual and on-going basis and will help support U.S. capital deployments needs. For those international earnings still considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. See Note 10 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3M\u2019s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3M\u2019s commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. At December 31, 2018, there was approximately $435 million in commercial paper issued and outstanding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Debt:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe strength of 3M\u2019s capital structure and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company\u2019s maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. 3M currently has an AA- credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard\u00a0& Poor\u2019s and has an A1 credit rating with a stable outlook from Moody\u2019s Investors Service. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s total debt was $0.7 billion higher at December 31, 2018 when compared to December\u00a031, 2017. Increases in debt related to September 2018 debt issuances of $2.25 billion along with the net impact of repayments and borrowings of international subsidiaries along with foreign currency effects. These were partially offset by August 2018 and November 2018 maturation of $450 million and 500 million Euro, respectively, aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes in addition to commercial paper of $435 million outstanding at year end 2018 compared to $745 million outstanding at year end 2017. For discussion of repayments of and proceeds from debt refer to the following \u201cCash Flows from Financing Activities\u201d section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffective February\u00a024, 2017, the Company updated its \u201cwell-known seasoned issuer\u201d (WKSI) shelf registration statement, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future issuance and sale. This replaced 3M\u2019s previous shelf registration dated May\u00a016, 2014. In May 2016, in connection with the WKSI shelf, 3M entered into an amended and restated distribution agreement relating to the future issuance and sale (from time to time) of the Company\u2019s medium-term notes program (Series F), up to the aggregate principal amount of $18 billion, which was an increase from the previous aggregate principal amount up to $9 billion of the same Series.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2018, the total amount of debt issued as part of the medium-term notes program (Series F), inclusive of debt issued in 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and the 2018 debt referenced above, is approximately $15.3 billion (utilizing the foreign exchange rates applicable at the time of issuance for the Euro denominated debt). Information with respect to long-term debt issuances and maturities for the periods presented is included in Note 12. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn March 2016, 3M amended and restated its existing $2.25 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in August 2019 to a $3.75 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in March 2021. This credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to $1.25 billion (at lenders\u2019 discretion), bringing the total facility up to $5.0 billion. This revolving credit facility is undrawn at December 31, 2018. Under the $3.75 billion credit agreement, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2018, this ratio was approximately 25 to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends. Apart from the committed facilities, an additional $243 million in stand-alone letters of credit and bank guarantees were also issued and outstanding at December 31, 2018. These instruments are utilized in connection with normal business activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n43\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt December 31, 2018, 3M had $3.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $3.1 billion was held by the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries and approximately $160 million was held by the United States. These balances are invested in bank instruments and other high-quality fixed income securities. At December\u00a031, 2017, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries and by the United States totaled approximately $3.975 billion and $180 million, respectively.

Therefore, ROIC should not be considered a substitute for other measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines ROIC as adjusted net income (net income including non-controlling interest plus after-tax interest expense) divided by average invested capital (equity plus debt). The Company believes ROIC is meaningful to investors as it focuses on shareholder value creation.

funding decisions, tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2018, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $199 million compared to the same period last year, with the increase primarily made up of higher net income and lower year-on-year pension and postretirement contributions. The increase was partially offset primarily due to the Minnesota NRD resolution in the first quarter of 2018 and year-on-year increases in income tax payments. Additional factors that decreased operating cash flows were increases in inventory and accounts receivable. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by $406 million in 2018, compared to the working capital increases of $608 million in 2017. Additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the \u201cFinancial Condition and Liquidity\u201d section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2017, cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $422 million compared to the same period last year. Factors that decreased operating cash flows were increases in pension contributions, plus year-on-year increases in working capital. In December 2017, 3M contributed $600 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan, contributing to a year-on-year increase in pension and postretirement contributions of $584 million. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by $608 million in 2017, compared to working capital increases of $108 million in 2016. In 2017, year-on-year decreases in income tax payments (net of refunds) increased operating cash flows by $284 million. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash Flows from Investing Activities:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYears ended December\u00a031\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Millions)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment (PP&E)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (1,577)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (1,373)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (1,420)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProceeds from sale of PP&E and other assets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 262\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 58\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcquisitions, net of cash acquired\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (2,023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (16)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurchases and proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities\u00a0and\u00a0investments, net\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 669\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (798)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (163)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProceeds from sale of businesses, net of cash sold\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 846\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1,065\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 142\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther \u2014 net\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a09\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 222\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (3,086)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (1,403)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n46\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency.

Therefore, they should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The Company defines free cash flow conversion as free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3M. The Company believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are meaningful to investors as they are useful measures of performance and the Company uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash.

tax expense related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The expense is primarily related to the TCJA\u2019s transition tax. The transition tax is payable over 8 years at the election of the taxpayer. As discussed in Note 10, this balance was finalized in 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnconditional purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company. Included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts, capital commitments, service agreements and utilities. These estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year. Many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3M guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers. The Company expects to receive consideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. Contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table, but these commitments represent a small part of the Company\u2019s expected capital spending. The purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which the Company is contractually obligated. The majority of 3M\u2019s products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional commitment. For this reason, these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the Company\u2019s expected future cash outflows on a stand-alone basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther obligations, included in the preceding table within the caption entitled \u201cUnconditional purchase obligations and other,\u201d include the current portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under ASC 740, which is expected to be paid out in cash in the next 12 months, when applicable. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term payments, or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time; therefore, the long-term portion of the total net tax liability of $655 million is excluded from the preceding table. In addition, the transition tax prescribed under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) is separately included in the table above. Refer to Note 10 for further details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs discussed in Note 13, the Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2019 and Company contributions to its U.S. and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in future years; therefore, amounts related to these plans are not included in the preceding table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMEN\n\nTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions. The Company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount.

Changes in those factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows. Senior management provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities, determines certain of the Company\u2019s financial risk policies and objectives, and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization. Senior management also establishes certain associated procedures relative to control and valuation, risk analysis, counterparty credit approval, and ongoing monitoring and reporting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity price swaps, and forward and option contracts. However, the Company\u2019s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeign Exchange Rates Risk:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company\u2019s net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. 3M is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the U.S. dollar. The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. 3M may dedesignate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction. The maximum length of time over which 3M hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions is 36 months. In addition, 3M enters into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset, in part, the impacts of certain intercompany activities (primarily associated with intercompany licensing arrangements and intercompany financing transactions). As circumstances warrant, the Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency denominated debt as hedging instruments to hedge portions of the Company\u2019s net investments in foreign operations. The dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the Company\u2019s foreign exchange forward and option contracts designated as either cash flow hedges or net investment hedges was $3.4 billion at December 31, 2018. The dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the Company\u2019s foreign exchange forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments was $2.5 billion at December\u00a031, 2018. In addition, as of December\u00a031, 2018, the Company had 4.1 billion Euros in principal amount of foreign currency denominated debt designated as non-derivative hedging instruments in certain net investment hedges as discussed in Note 14 in the \u201cNet Investment Hedges\u201d section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest Rates Risk:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company may be impacted by interest rate volatility with respect to existing debt and future debt issuances. 3M manages interest rate risk and expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. In addition, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The dollar equivalent (based on inception date foreign currency exchange rates) gross notional amount of the Company\u2019s interest rate swaps at December\u00a031, 2018 was $2.4 billion. Additional details about 3M\u2019s long-term debt can be found in Note 12, including references to information regarding derivatives and/or hedging instruments, further discussed in Note 14, associated with the Company\u2019s long-term debt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommodity Prices Risk:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps. The related mark-to-market gain or loss on qualifying hedges was included in other comprehensive income to the extent effective, and reclassified into cost of sales in the period during which the hedged transaction affected earnings.

A Monte Carlo simulation technique was used to test the impact on after-tax earnings related to financial instruments (primarily debt), derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at December\u00a031, 2018. The model (third-party bank dataset) used a 95 percent confidence level over a 12-month time horizon. The exposure to changes in currency rates model used 9 currencies, interest rates related to two currencies, and commodity prices related to five commodities. This model does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the Company. This model does not include certain hedge transactions, because the Company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results.

This estimate includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies into U.S. dollars; the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3M operations in the United States and abroad; and transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks. 3M estimates that year-on-year derivative and other transaction gains and losses decreased pre-tax income by approximately $92 million and $152 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn analysis of the global exposures related to purchased components and materials is performed at each year-end.

The global energy exposure is such that a ten percent price change would result in a pre-tax cost or savings of approximately $42 million per year. Global energy exposure includes energy costs used in 3M production and other facilities, primarily electricity and natural gas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, "21": {"item1a": ">Item 1A. \n\nRisk Factors\n\n\u200b\n\nProvided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the Company.

Climate change, as well as related environmental and social regulations, may negatively impact the Company or its customers and suppliers, in terms of availability and cost of natural resources, sources and supply of energy, product demand and manufacturing, and the health and well-being of individuals and communities in which we operate.\n\n* The Company is subject to risks related to public health crises such as the global pandemic associated with\n\n \n\nthe coronavirus (COVID-19).\u00a0\n\n3M, as a global company, is impacted by public health crises such as the global pandemic associated with COVID-19. The outbreak has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. In addition, public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as the imposition of travel restrictions and the adoption of remote working, have impacted 3M\u2019s operations. In these challenging and dynamic circumstances, 3M continues to work to protect its employees and the public, maintain business continuity and sustain its operations, including ensuring the safety and protection of approximately 50,000 people who work in our plants and distribution centers across the world, many of whom support the manufacturing and delivery of products that are critical in response to the global pandemic. COVID-19 has impacted 3M\u2019s supply chains relative to global demand for products like respirators, surgical masks and commercial cleaning solutions. Even with 3M\u2019s accelerated production at its global facilities combined with capacity from other manufacturers, the industry-wide challenge is that global demand for N95 and other respirators continues to exceed the industries\u2019 ability to deliver. Within individual regions and countries around the world, 3M is working with governments, distributors and others to prioritize supplies to the most critical customer and public health needs. 3M\u2019s manufacturing, supply chain and distribution protocols have, for example, been impacted by the need to prioritize rated orders issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency pursuant to the U.S. Defense Production Act. In addition, trade barriers, export restrictions and other similar measures imposed by national governments also negatively impact the supplies of personal protection equipment including those made by 3M going into the most needed areas. COVID-19 has also affected the ability of suppliers and vendors to provide products and services to 3M. Some of these COVID-related factors have increased demand for certain 3M products, while others have decreased demand from certain end markets or could make it more difficult for 3M to serve customers. 3M has received reports of price gouging, counterfeiting and other illegal or fraudulent activities involving its N95 respirators, has taken legal action in several states and continues to work with state, federal and international law enforcement to protect the public and 3M against those who seek to exploit 3M\u2019s brand and reputation and defraud others. Furthermore, COVID-19 has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. For example, COVID-19 has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which increases the cost of capital and could adversely impact access to capital. As economies start to reopen in certain parts of the world, workplace safety, for the Company and others, will increasingly become a focus of concern. As part of the return to work process at the Company, the Company could face additional privacy and data security risks related to the collection of data regarding employees and contractors with respect to COVID-19 testing, temperature checks, and contact tracing. Due to the speed and scope with which the COVID situation is developing and evolving and the uncertainty of its duration and the timing of recovery, 3M is not able at this time to predict the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\n\n*\u00a0Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company\u2019s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings.\u00a0\n\nBecause the Company\u2019s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and approximately 60 percent of the Company\u2019s revenues are derived from outside the United States, the Company\u2019s results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the U.S. dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies.\n\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Proceedings\n\n*\u00a0\n\nThe Company faces liabilities related to certain fluorochemicals, which could adversely impact our results.\n\n11\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAs previously reported, the Company has been voluntarily cooperating with various local, state, federal (primarily the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)), and international agencies in their review of the environmental and health effects of a broad group of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances produced by the Company, collectively known as \u201cPFAS.\u201d The PFAS group contains several categories and classes of durable chemicals and materials with properties that include oil, water, temperature, chemical and fire resistance, as well as electrical insulating properties. The strength of the carbon-fluorine bond also means that these compounds do not easily degrade. These characteristics have made PFAS critical to the manufacture of electronic devices such as cell phones, tablets and semi-conductors. They are also used to help prevent infections in products like surgical gowns and drapes. Commercial aircraft and low-emissions vehicles also rely on PFAS technology.\u00a0PFAS compounds are manufactured by various companies, including 3M,\u00a0and are used in everyday products. As science and technology evolve and advance, and in response to evolving knowledge and the understanding that PFAS compounds had the potential to build up over time, 3M announced in 2000 that we would voluntarily phase out production of perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) globally as a precautionary measure. We phased out of materials used to produce certain repellants and surfactant products, with most of these activities in the U.S. completed by the end of 2002. Phased out products included Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) and coatings for food packaging, for example. 3M currently is defending lawsuits concerning various PFAS-related products and chemistries, and is subject to unasserted and asserted claims and governmental regulatory proceedings and inquiries related to the production and use of PFAS in a variety of jurisdictions, as discussed in Note 16, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies,\u201d within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. An adverse outcome in any one or more of these matters could be material to our financial results. For example, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $897 million, inclusive of legal fees and other related obligations, in the first quarter of 2018 with respect to the settlement of a matter brought by the State of Minnesota involving the presence of PFAS in the groundwater, surface water, fish or other aquatic life, and sediments in the state. Governmental inquiries or lawsuits involving PFAS could lead to our incurring liability for damages or other costs, civil or criminal proceedings, the imposition of fines and penalties, or other remedies, as well as restrictions on or added costs for our business operations going forward, including in the form of restrictions on discharges at our manufacturing facilities or otherwise.\n\n*\u00a0The Company\u2019s future results may be affected by various asserted and unasserted legal and regulatory proceedings and legal compliance risks, including those involving product liability, antitrust, intellectual property, environmental, tax, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws, U.S. trade sanctions compliance, regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and similar foreign agencies, U.S. federal healthcare program-related laws and regulations including the False Claims Act, anti-kickback laws, the Sunshine Act, or other matters.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLegal compliance risks also include third-party risks where the Company\u2019s suppliers, vendors or channel partners have business practices that are inconsistent with 3M\u2019s Supplier Responsibility Code, 3M performance requirements or with legal requirements.\n\nThe outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the Company\u2019s expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to reliably predict. Although the Company maintains general liability insurance, the amount of liability that may result from certain of these risks may not always be covered by, or could exceed, the applicable insurance coverage. Various factors or developments can lead the Company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period. In addition, negative publicity related to product liability, environmental, health and safety or other matters referenced above involving the Company may negatively impact the Company\u2019s reputation. For a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the Company and the associated accounting estimates, see the discussion in Note 16, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies,\u201d within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nRisks Related to Our Products and Customer Preferences\n\n*\u00a0The Company\u2019s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDemand for the Company\u2019s products, which impacts revenue and profit margins, is affected by (i)\u00a0the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products; (ii)\u00a0the Company\u2019s response to downward pricing to stay competitive; (iii)\u00a0changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in the Company\u2019s incentive programs, or the customer\u2019s ability to achieve incentive goals; (iv)\u00a0changes in customers\u2019 preferences for our products, including the success of products offered by our competitors, and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the Company\u2019s products; and (v) changes in the \n\n12\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nbusiness environment related to disruptive technologies, such as artificial intelligence, block-chain, expanded analytics and other enhanced learnings from increasing volume of available data. \n\n*\u00a0The Company\u2019s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings, including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis ability is subject to difficulties or delays in product development, such as the inability to identify viable new products, obtain adequate intellectual property protection, or gain market acceptance of new products. There are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful.\n\n*\u00a0The Company\u2019s future results are subject to vulnerability with respect to materials and fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components, compounds, raw materials and energy, due to shortages, increased demand, supply interruptions, manufacturing site disruptions, natural disasters and other disruptive factors.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Company depends on various components, compounds, raw materials, and energy (including oil and natural gas and their derivatives) supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products. Supplier relationships have been and could be interrupted in the future due to supplier material shortage, climate impacts, natural and other disasters and other disruptive events, or be terminated. Any sustained interruption in the Company\u2019s receipt of adequate supplies or disruption to key manufacturing sites\u2019 operations could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, while the Company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.\n\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\n*\u00a0The Company employs information technology systems to support its business, including ongoing phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system as part of business transformation on a worldwide basis over the next several years. Security breaches and other disruptions to the Company\u2019s information technology infrastructure could interfere with the Company\u2019s operations, compromise information belonging to the Company or its customers, suppliers, and employees, exposing the Company to liability which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business and reputation.\u00a0\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company relies on centralized and local information technology networks and systems, some of which are provided, hosted or managed by vendors and other third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of businesses. Additionally, the Company collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and has access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. Despite our cybersecurity and business continuity measures (including employee and third-party training, monitoring of networks and systems, patching, maintenance, and backup of systems and data), the Company\u2019s information technology networks and infrastructure are still potentially vulnerable to the security risks of our vendors and third-party service providers, security breaches, damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by threat actors including nation-state actors, computer viruses, hardware, software, and system vulnerabilities, ransomware, service or cloud provider disruptions or security breaches, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. The Company\u2019s increased adoption of remote working, which was driven by the pandemic, may also introduce additional threats to our information technology networks and infrastructure. Despite our cybersecurity measures, it is possible for security vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended time period, up to and including several years. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, threats and disruptions to the Company\u2019s information technology infrastructure, none of them to date has had a material impact to the Company. Any such threats or disruptions could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, interference with the Company\u2019s operations, and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. Although the Company maintains insurance coverage for various cybersecurity and business continuity risks, there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured.\n\n\u200b\n\n*\u00a0Acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies, and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results.\u00a0\n\nThe Company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures and changes to its organizational structure. With respect to acquisitions, including, for example, the recently completed acquisition of Acelity, Inc. and its KCI subsidiaries (a leading global medical technology company), future results will be affected by the Company\u2019s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies. The Company \n\n13\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nrealigned from five to four business segments, effective in April of 2019, to better serve its global customers and markets. Successful execution of the realignment and the associated adjustments of our portfolio and business operating model, as well as other organizational changes, will be important to the Company\u2019s future results.\n\n*\u00a0The Company\u2019s future results may be affected by its operational execution, including scenarios where the Company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Company\u2019s financial results depend on the successful execution of its business operating plans. The Company utilizes various tools, such as Lean Six Sigma, and engages in ongoing global business transformation. Business transformation is defined as changes in processes and internal/external service delivery across 3M to move to more efficient business models to improve operational efficiency and productivity, while allowing 3M to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency. This is enabled by the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an ERP system. There can be no assurance that all of the projected productivity improvements will be realized. In addition, the ability to adapt to business model and other changes and agility to respond to customer needs and service expectations are important, which, if not done successfully, could negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to win new business and enhance revenue and 3M\u2019s brand. Operational challenges, including those related to customer service, pace of change and productivity improvements, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial conditions and results of operations.\n\nRisks Related to Financial and Capital Markets and Tax Matters\n\n*\u00a0The Company's defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our results.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe performance of financial markets and discount rates impact the Company's funding obligations under its defined benefit plans. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets, and legislative or regulatory changes relating to defined benefit plan funding may increase the Company's funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows.\n\n*\u00a0Change in the Company\u2019s credit ratings could increase cost of funding.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Company\u2019s credit ratings are important to 3M\u2019s cost of capital. The major rating agencies routinely evaluate the Company\u2019s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3M. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include financial strength, business and financial risk, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. 3M currently has an A1 credit rating with a negative outlook from Moody\u2019s Investors Service and an A+ credit rating with a negative outlook from Standard & Poor\u2019s. The Company\u2019s credit ratings have served to lower 3M\u2019s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders. The addition of further leverage to the Company\u2019s capital structure could impact 3M\u2019s credit ratings in the future. Failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings would adversely affect the Company\u2019s cost of funding and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets.\n\n\u200b\n\n*\u00a0Changes in tax rates, laws or regulations could adversely impact our financial results.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to tax-related external conditions, such as tax rates, tax laws and regulations, changing political environments in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions that impact tax examination, assessment and enforcement approaches. In addition, changes in tax laws including further regulatory developments arising from U.S. tax reform legislation and/or regulations around the world could result in a tax expense or benefit recorded to the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. In connection with the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Integrated Framework provided by Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), determination of multi-jurisdictional taxation rights and the rate of tax applicable to certain types of income may be subject to potential change. Due to uncertainty of the regulation changes and other tax-related factors stated above, it is currently not possible to assess the ultimate impact of these actions on our financial statements.", "item1b": ">Item 1B. \n\nUnresolved Staff Comment\n\ns.\n\n\u200b\n\nNone.\n\n\u200b\n\n14\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nItem 2. \n\nPropertie\n\ns.\n\n\u200b\n\nIn the U.S., 3M\u2019s general offices, corporate research laboratories, and certain division laboratories are located in St. Paul, Minnesota.

As more fully described in both the Performance by Business Segment section in MD&A and in Note 19, effective in the first quarter of 2020, the Company changed its business segment reporting in its continuing effort to improve the alignment of businesses around markets and customers. Additionally, the Company consolidated the way it presents geographic area net sales by providing an aggregate Americas geographic region (combining former United States and Latin America and Canada areas). Also, effective in the second quarter of 2020, the measure of segment operating performance used by 3M\u2019s chief operating decision maker changed and, as a result, the Company\u2019s disclosed measure of segment profit/loss has been updated. Business segment information presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. \n\n\u200b\n\n3M manages its operations in four operating business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer. From a geographic perspective, any references to EMEA refer to Europe, Middle East and Africa on a combined basis.\n\n\u200b\n\nConsideration of COVID-19:\n\n\u200b\n\n3M is impacted by the global pandemic and related effects associated with the coronavirus (COVID-19). The Company updated its risk factors with respect to COVID-19, which can be found in Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this document. \n\n\u200b\n\nPublic and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as the imposition of travel restrictions and the adoption of remote working, have impacted 3M\u2019s operations. 3M continues to work to protect its employees and the public, maintain business continuity and sustain its operations, including ensuring the safety and protection of people who work in its plants and distribution centers across the world, many of whom support the manufacturing and delivery of products that are critical in response to the global pandemic. COVID-19 has impacted 3M\u2019s supply chains relative to global demand for products like respirators, surgical masks and commercial cleaning solutions. As this situation continues, 3M also closely monitors and responds to potential impacts to the Company\u2019s broader supply chain associated with other products. COVID-19 has also affected the ability of suppliers and vendors to provide products and services to 3M. Furthermore, COVID-19 has impacted the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth.The Company has taken steps to help employees lead safe and productive lives during the outbreak including remote working; escalated procedures in factories related to personal safety, cleaning and medical screening measures; and pandemic leave policies. 3M closely monitors how the spread of COVID-19 is affecting employees and business operations and has preparedness plans to help protect the safety of employees around the world while safely continuing business. While nearly all of our manufacturing locations and distribution centers are fully or partially operational, the Company \n\n18\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nimplemented plant and/or line shutdowns during 2020 related to certain markets due to weaker customer demand or government mandates. Some of the above factors have increased the demand for 3M products, while others have decreased demand or made it more difficult for 3M to serve customers. Serving 3M customers is a priority and teams continue to communicate with individual customers about potential disruptions. \n\n\u200b\n\n3M\u2019s total sales increased 0.1% for the full year 2020 when compared to 2019. Organic local-currency sales decreased 1.7% for the full year 2020 when compared to 2019. Given the diversity of 3M\u2019s businesses, the impact of COVID-19 varied across the Company throughout 2020. 3M experienced strong sales growth in personal safety, as well as in other areas such as home improvement, general cleaning, semiconductor, data center, and biopharma filtration. COVID-related respirator sales are estimated to have impacted year-on-year organic local-currency sales growth by approximately 3 percent for the year ending December 31, 2020. At the same time, weakness in several end markets, while improving, contributed in part to sales declines in a number of 3M\u2019s businesses with the biggest year-on-year total sales decreases in oral care (down 19 percent), advanced materials (down 17 percent), automotive and aerospace (down 16 percent), commercial solutions (down 14 percent), stationery and office (down 11 percent), closure and masking (down 11 percent), automotive aftermarket (down 10 percent), and businesses aligned to general industrial applications such as abrasives (down 15 percent) and industrial adhesives and tapes (down 5 percent).\n\n\u200b\n\n3M\u2019s operating income margins increased 3.1 percentage points year-on-year for the year ending December 31, 2020. Factoring out the impact on operating income of special items as described in the \n\nCertain amounts adjusted for special items -\u00a0(non-GAAP measures)\n\n section below, operating income margins increased 0.1 points to 21.3 percent for the year ending December 31, 2020 when compared to 2019. Various COVID-19 implications contributed in part to these results.\n\n\u200b\n\nOverall, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 3M\u2019s consolidated results of operations was primarily driven by factors related to changes in demand for products and disruption in global supply chains as described above. While it is not feasible to identify or quantify all the other direct and indirect implications on 3M\u2019s results of operations, below are factors that 3M believes have also affected its 2020 results:\n\n\u200b\n\nFactors contributing to charges:\n\n\u25cf\n\nPeriod expenses of unabsorbed manufacturing costs and increased expected credit losses on customer receivables.\n\n\u25cf\n\nRestructuring actions addressing structural enterprise costs and operations in certain end markets as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic impact resulting in a second quarter 2020 charge of $58 million (as further discussed in Note 5).\n\n\u25cf\n\nCommitted financial support to various COVID-relief and medical research initiatives.\n\n\u25cf\n\nCharge of $22 million related to equity securities as discussed in the \u201c\n\nAssets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\u201d\n\n section of Note 15 that use the measurement alternative described therein in addition to an immaterial pre-tax charge related to impairment of certain indefinite lived tradenames in the first quarter of 2020. 3M continues to regularly consider if COVID-19 and other related market implications could indicate it is more likely than not the carrying amount of various applicable assets may be impaired and assess whether certain investments without readily determinable fair values may have been impacted. \n\n\u200b\n\nFactors providing benefits or other impacts:\n\n\u25cf\n\nDecreased discretionary spending in areas such as travel, professional services, and advertising/merchandising as well as \n\ncost reduction efforts, hiring freezes, and maintaining only essential contract workers. 3M continues to monitor discretionary spending and deploy cost control efforts as the situation continues.\n\n\u25cf\n\nGovernment-sponsored COVID-response stimulus and relief initiatives, including certain employment retention benefits under the \n\nCoronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act in the United States.\n\n\u25cf\n\nLower self-insured medical visit/instance expense during 2020.\n\n\u25cf\n\nInstituted accelerated vacation usage policies which benefited the second quarter of 2020 year-on-year, but provided a penalty in comparison to prior year in the second half of 2020.\n\n\u200b\n\nAs previously disclosed, in light of circumstances, 3M took actions to ensure sources of cash may remain strong, including the March 2020 issuance of $1.75 billion of registered notes, suspension of share repurchases, and the decrease of its 2020 capital spending to approximately $1.5 billion. While capital spending decreased, it included additional expansion of respirator production capacity. 3M continues to have access to its commercial paper program and undrawn committed credit facility. Refer to the Financial Condition and Liquidity section below for more information on the Company\u2019s liquidity position.\n\n19\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe Company also continues to evaluate the extent to which it may avail itself of various government-sponsored COVID-response stimulus, relief, and production initiatives around the world, such as under the Defense Production Act (DPA) and CARES Act in the United States. During 2020 and into January 2021, 3M reached certain agreements with governments in the U.S. and other countries involving just over $250 million of asset funding to expand capacity to supply N-95 respirators. \n\n\u200b\n\nDue to the speed with which the COVID-19 situation is developing and evolving and the uncertainty of its duration and the timing of recovery, 3M is not able at this time to predict the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\n\n\u200b\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) attributable to 3M common shareholders \u2013 diluted:\n\n\u200b\n\nThe following table provides the increase (decrease) in diluted earnings per share for 2020 compared to the same period last year, in addition to 2019 compared to 2018.

Partially offsetting this net decrease in earnings per share were year-on-year net gains related to certain property sales (in 2020 within Safety and Industrial and in 2019 within Corporate and Unallocated) in addition to benefits recognized in 2020 related to the restructuring and other actions taken in 2019 (and the adjustments thereto in 2020) along with continued cost management and productivity efforts. \n\n\u25cf\n\nOn a combined basis, higher defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost increased expense year-on-year.\n\n\u25cf\n\nInterest expense (net of interest income) increased in 2020, as a result of higher U.S. average debt balances and lower year-on-year interest income driven by lower average interest rates on cash balances. 2020 interest expense also included an early debt extinguishment charge in conjunction with the repayment of notes in December 2020.\n\n\u200b\n\nNon divestiture-related restructuring actions:\n\n\u25cf\n\n3M recorded non divestiture-related restructuring pre-tax charges aggregating $195 million in 2020. These included charges in the second quarter of 2020 to address certain COVID-related impacts and in the fourth quarter as 3M initiated actions to further enhance its operational and marketing capabilities. In 2019, charges included $282 million as the Company committed to actions in light of slower than expected 2019 sales and associated with realigning its organizational structure and operating model. See Note 5 for additional details. \n\n\u25cf\n\nThe year-on-year impact of the non divestiture-related restructuring actions taken in 2020 and 2019 increased earnings per diluted share by 12 cents.\n\n\u200b\n\nAcquisitions/divestitures:\n\n\u25cf\n\nAcquisition impacts, which are measured for the first twelve months post-transaction, relate to the acquisitions of M*Modal (first quarter 2019), and Acelity (fourth quarter 2019). These items collectively decreased earnings per diluted share by 7 year-on-year for 2020. The net impacts related to these acquisitions included income from operations, more than offset by transaction and integration costs. Financing costs related to these acquisitions is also included. \n\n\u25cf\n\nDivestiture impacts include the lost operating income from divested businesses, which decreased earnings per diluted share by 3 cents year-on-year for 2020. This was primarily related to the divestiture of the Company\u2019s drug delivery business.\n\n\u200b\n\nForeign exchange impacts:\n\n\u25cf\n\nForeign currency impacts (net of hedging) decreased pre-tax earnings year-on-year by approximately $81 million in 2020, which decreased earnings per diluted share by 11 cents, excluding the impact of foreign currency changes on tax rates. \n\n\u200b\n\nIncome tax rate\n\n:\n\n\u25cf\n\nCertain items above reflect specific income tax rates associated therewith. Overall, the effective tax rate for 2020 was 19.6 percent, a decrease of 0.2 percentage points versus 2019. On an adjusted basis (as discussed below), the effective tax rate increased 0.1 percentage points year-on-year for 2020.\n\n\u25cf\n\nFactors that decreased the effective tax rate for 2020 included geographical income mix and adjustments to uncertain tax positions.

Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding in 2020 declined 0.5 percent year-on-year, which benefited earnings per share. The decrease in the outstanding weighted-average diluted shares relates to the Company\u2019s purchase of $368 million of its own stock, prior to suspension of share repurchases under its board-approved stock repurchase program in late March 2020 with other repurchase activity limited to 3M\u2019s stock compensation plans.\n\n\u200b\n\nYear 2019 EPS:\n\n\u200b\n\nOrganic growth/productivity and other: \n\n\u25cf\n\nNegative organic local-currency sales growth as a result of softness in certain end markets and channel inventory adjustments, along with actions taken by 3M in response to lower sales volumes and high inventory levels, which resulted in lower manufacturing and inventory absorption, reduced earnings per diluted share. Partially offsetting these impacts were benefits from restructuring actions taken in the second quarter of 2019.\n\n21\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\u25cf\n\nDefined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense decreased expense year-on-year, which benefited earnings per diluted share.\n\n\u25cf\n\nLower income related to non-service cost components of pension and postretirement expense, increased expense year-on-year.\n\n\u25cf\n\nInterest expense (net of interest income) increased in 2019, as a result of higher U.S. average debt balances, partially offset by the increase in interest income driven by higher balances in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities during the year resulting from the proceeds from debt issuances in advance of the October 2019 Acelity acquisition.\n\n\u200b\n\nNon divestiture-related restructuring actions:\n\n\u25cf\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2019, in light of slower than expected 2019 sales, and additionally in the fourth quarter to realign\n\n \n\n3M\u2019s organizational structure and operating model, management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions. In aggregate, the Company recorded a full year 2019 combined pre-tax charge of $282 million, or 41 cents per diluted share. See Note 5 for additional details.\n\n\u200b\n\nAcquisitions/divestitures:\n\n\u25cf\n\nAcquisition impacts, which are measured for the first twelve months post-transaction, relate to the acquisitions of M*Modal (first quarter 2019), and Acelity (fourth quarter 2019). These items collectively decreased earnings per diluted share by 19 cents year-on-year for 2019. The net impacts related to these acquisitions included income from operations, more than offset by transaction and integration costs. Interest expense related to financing costs of these acquisitions is also included. Expenses related to the October 2019 acquisition of Acelity also include financing costs and the tax effect of repatriating funds in advance of the close of the acquisition.\n\n\u25cf\n\nDivestiture impacts collectively decreased earnings per diluted share by 5 cents year-on-year for 2019. They include remaining stranded costs and lost operating income related to the 2018 divestiture of the Communication Markets Division, which decreased earnings per diluted share by 4 cents year-on-year, and lost operating income from other divested businesses (primarily the Company\u2019s gas and flame detection business), which decreased earnings per diluted share by 1 cent year-on-year.\n\n\u200b\n\nForeign exchange impacts:\n\n\u25cf\n\nForeign currency impacts (net of hedging) were essentially flat year-on-year, excluding the impact of foreign currency changes on tax rates. \n\n\u200b\n\nIncome tax rate\n\n:\n\n\u25cf\n\nCertain items above reflect specific income tax rates associated therewith. Overall, the effective tax rate for 2019 was 19.8 percent, a decrease of 3.6 percentage points versus 2018. On an adjusted basis (as discussed below), the effective tax rate increased 0.2 percentage points year-on-year for 2019.\n\n\u25cf\n\nFactors that decreased the effective tax rate on a GAAP basis for 2019 included prior year measurement period adjustments related to 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), prior year resolution of the NRD lawsuit (as described in Note 16) and geographical income mix. These decreases were partially offset by the deconsolidation of the Venezuelan subsidiary, adjustments to uncertain tax positions, and significant litigation-related charges. Refer to Note 10 for additional details.\n\n\u200b\n\nShares of common stock outstanding:\n\n\u25cf\n\nLower shares outstanding increased earnings per share year-on-year by 22 cents per diluted share for 2019. Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding in 2019 declined 2.8 percent year-on-year which benefited earnings per share. The decrease in the outstanding weighted-average diluted shares relates to the Company\u2019s purchase of $1.4 billion of its own stock in 2019.\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n22\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCertain amounts adjusted for special items -\u00a0(non-GAAP measures): \n\n\u200b\n\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company also provides non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impacts of special items. For the periods presented, special items include the items described below. Beginning in 2020, the Company includes gain/loss on sale of businesses and divestiture-related restructuring actions as special items due to their potential distortion of underlying operating results. Information provided herein reflects the impact of this change for all periods presented. Operating income (measure of segment operating performance), income before taxes, net income, earnings per share, and the effective tax rate are all measures for which 3M provides the reported GAAP measure and a measure adjusted for special items. The adjusted measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP measures. The Company considers these non-GAAP measures in evaluating and managing the Company\u2019s operations. The Company believes that discussion of results adjusted for these items is meaningful to investors as it provides a useful analysis of ongoing underlying operating trends. The determination of these items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Special items include:\n\n\u200b\n\nSignificant litigation-related charges/benefits:\n\n\u25cf\n\nIn 2020, 3M recorded a net pre-tax charge of $17 million ($13 million after tax) related to PFAS (certain perfluorinated compounds) matters. The charge was more than offset by a reduction in tax expense of $52 million related to resolution of tax treatment with authorities regarding the previously disclosed 2018 agreement reached with the State of Minnesota that resolved the Natural Resources Damages lawsuit. These items, in aggregate, resulted in a $39 million after tax benefit. \n\n\u25cf\n\nIn 2019, the Company recorded significant litigation-related charges of $762 million ($590 million after tax) related to PFAS matters and coal mine dust respirator mask lawsuits of which $214 million ($166 million after tax) occurred in the fourth quarter. The aggregate 2019 pre-tax charge was reflected in cost of sales ($328 million) and selling, general and administrative expense ($434 million). These charges are further discussed in Note 16.\n\n\u25cf\n\nIn 2018, the Company recorded significant litigation-related charges of $897 million ($770 million after tax) for PFAS matters related to the previously disclosed agreement reached with the State of Minnesota that resolved the Natural Resource Damages lawsuit. Essentially all of the aggregate 2018 pre-tax charge was reflected in selling, general and administrative expense.\n\n\u200b\n\nGain/loss on sale of businesses:\n\n\u25cf\n\nIn the first quarter of 2020, 3M recorded a pre-tax gain of $2 million ($1 million loss after tax) related to the sale of its advanced ballistic-protection business and recognition of certain contingent consideration. In the second quarter of 2020, 3M recorded a pre-tax gain of $387 million ($304 million after tax) related to the sale of its drug delivery business. Refer to Note 3 for further details.\n\n\u25cf\n\nIn the first quarter of 2019, 3M recorded a gain related to the sale of certain oral care technology comprising a business in addition to reflecting an earnout on a previous divestiture, which together resulted in a net gain of $8 million ($7 million after tax). In the second quarter of 2019, as a result of a \u201cheld for sale\u201d tax benefit related to the legal entities associated with the pending divestiture of the Company\u2019s gas and flame detection business, 3M recorded an after-tax gain of $43 million. In the third quarter of 2019, 3M recorded a gain related to the divestiture of the Company\u2019s gas and flame detection business and an immaterial impact as a result of measuring a disposal group at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell, which in aggregate resulted in a pre-tax gain of $106 million ($79 million after tax).\n\n\u25cf\n\nIn the first quarter of 2018, 3M recorded a gain related to the sale of \n\ncertain personal safety product offerings primarily focused on noise, environmental, and heat stress monitoring, the sale of\n\n its polymer additives compounding business, and a gain on final closing adjustments from a prior divestiture which, in aggregate, resulted in a net pre-tax gain of $24 million ($19 million after tax). In the second quarter of 2018, 3M recorded a pre-tax gain of $12 million ($10 million after tax) related to the sale of its abrasive glass products business. In the fourth quarter of 2018, 3M recorded a gain of $2 million related to an earnout from a previous divestiture. Additionally, in 2018, 3M completed the sale of substantially all of its Communication Markets Division and reflected a pre-tax gain of $509 million ($410 million after tax).\n\n\u200b\n\nDivestiture-related restructuring actions:\n\n\u25cf\n\nIn the second quarter 2020, following the divestiture of substantially all of the drug delivery business (see Note 3) management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions addressing corporate functional costs and manufacturing footprint across 3M in relation to the magnitude of amounts previously allocated/burdened to the divested business. As a result, 3M recorded a second quarter 2020 pre-tax charge of $55 million ($46 million after tax) and made a subsequent immaterial adjustment thereto. Refer to Note 5 for further details.\n\n23\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\u25cf\n\nDuring 2018, management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions as further described in Note 5, related to addressing corporate functional costs following the Communication Markets Division divestiture resulting in a 2018 pre-tax charge of $127 million ($110 million after tax), net of adjustments for reductions in cost estimates of $10 million.\n\n\u200b\n\nLoss on deconsolidation of Venezuelan subsidiary:\n\n\u25cf\n\nIn the second quarter of 2019, 3M recorded a pre-tax charge of $162 million related to the deconsolidation of the Company\u2019s Venezuelan subsidiary as further discussed in Note 1.\n\n\u200b\n\nMeasurement period accounting for TCJA:\n\n\u25cf\n\n3M recorded a net tax expense of $176 million in 2018 as a measurement period adjustment to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).

Total sales remained flat in Mexico, as organic local-currency sales increases of 1 percent were partially offset by lost sales from divested businesses and foreign currency translation impacts. In Canada, total sales and organic local currency increased 3 percent. In Brazil, total sales decreased 4 percent, as organic local-currency sales growth of 3 percent was more than offset by foreign currency translation impacts.\n\n\u25cf\n\nIn the Asia Pacific geographic area, China total sales decreased 7 percent and organic local-currency sales decreased 4 percent. In Japan, total sales decreased 2 percent and organic local currency sales decreased 3 percent. \n\n\u200b\n\nForeign currency translation decreased year-on-year sales by 1.7 percent, while selling prices increased by 0.6 percent year-on-year for 2019, with price growth in EMEA and Americas, while Asia Pacific was flat. \n\n\u200b\n\nManaging currency risks:\n\nThe stronger U.S. dollar had a negative impact on sales in full year 2020 compared to the same period last year. Net of the Company\u2019s hedging strategy, foreign currency negatively impacted earnings for full year 2020 compared to the same period last year. 3M utilizes a number of tools to hedge currency risk related to earnings. 3M uses natural hedges such as pricing, productivity, hard currency and hard currency-indexed billings, and localizing source of supply. 3M also uses financial hedges to mitigate currency risk. In the case of more liquid currencies, 3M hedges a portion of its aggregate exposure, using a 12, 24 or 36 month horizon, depending on the currency in question. For less liquid currencies, financial hedging is frequently more expensive with more limitations on tenor. Thus, this risk is largely managed via local operational actions using natural hedging tools as discussed above. In either case, 3M\u2019s hedging approach is \n\n27\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\ndesigned to mitigate a portion of foreign currency risk and reduce volatility, ultimately allowing time for 3M\u2019s businesses to respond to changes in the marketplace.\n\n\u200b\n\nFinancial condition: \n\n\u200b\n\n3M generated $8.1 billion of operating cash flow in 2020, an increase of $1.0 billion when compared to 2019. This increase was primarily due to cost saving actions taken in response to COVID-19 and lower year-on-year significant litigation-related charges and the timing of associated payments. This followed an operating cash flow increase of $631 million when comparing 2019 to 2018. Refer to the section entitled \u201cFinancial Condition and Liquidity\u201d later in MD&A for a discussion of items impacting cash flows. \n\n\u200b\n\nIn November 2018, 3M\u2019s Board of Directors replaced the Company\u2019s February 2016 repurchase program with a new repurchase program. This new program authorizes the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M\u2019s outstanding common stock, with no pre-established end date. In 2020, the Company purchased $0.4 billion of its own stock, compared to purchases of $1.4 billion in 2019. As of December\u00a031, 2020, approximately $7.8 billion remained available under the authorization. In the first quarter of 2020, the Company suspended repurchases under its board-approved share repurchase program with other repurchase activity limited to 3M\u2019s stock compensation plans. The Company plans to resume share purchases in 2021. In February 2021, 3M\u2019s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2021 dividend of $1.48 per share, an increase of 1 percent. This marked the 63\n\nrd\n\n consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M. \n\n\u200b\n\nRaw materials:\n\n\u200b\n\nIn 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic caused fluctuations in supply markets. Generally, as demand for certain COVID-related products surged, 3M saw a corresponding tightening in supply and some degree of price inflation in associated markets. Within the supply chain of less essential products, 3M experienced raw material price deflation as economies slowed and certain producers scaled back or idled operations. Conversely, as markets re-opened and demand increased, the Company experienced raw material price inflation with some level of stabilization late in the year.\n\n\u200b\n\nIn response, the Company continued to deploy productivity projects to minimize the impact of raw material inflation and market supply challenges, including input management, reformulations, and multi-sourcing activities. Overall, on a consolidated basis, 3M experienced net raw material deflation in 2020. To date, the Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is difficult to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories, strategic relationships with key suppliers, and development as well as qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts and price protection agreements. In addition, 3M evaluates suppliers\u2019 conformance with environmental and social compliance requirements.\n\n\u200b\n\nPension and postretirement defined benefit/contribution plans:\n\n\u200b\n\nOn a worldwide basis, 3M\u2019s pension and postretirement plans were 87 percent funded at year-end 2020. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan, which is approximately 67 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 91 percent funded and the international pension plans were 93 percent funded. The U.S. non-qualified pension plan is not funded due to tax considerations and other factors. Asset returns in 2020 for the primary U.S. qualified pension plan were 13.6%, as 3M strategically invests in both growth assets and fixed income matching assets to manage its funded status. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2021 is 6.50%. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan year-end 2020 discount rate was 2.55%, down 0.70 percentage points from the year-end 2019 discount rate of 3.25%. The decrease in U.S. discount rates resulted in an increased valuation of the projected benefit obligation (PBO). The primary U.S. qualified pension plan\u2019s funded status decreased 1 percentage point in 2020 due to the higher PBO resulting from the discount rate decrease and partially offset by higher return on assets. Additional detail and discussion of international plan asset returns and discount rates is provided in Note 13 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans).\n\n\u200b\n\n3M expects to contribute approximately $100 million to $200 million of cash to its global defined benefit pension and postretirement plans in 2021. The Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2021. 3M expects global defined benefit pension and postretirement expense in 2021 to decrease by approximately $40 million pre-tax when \n\n28\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\ncompared to 2020.

The increase from 2019 to 2020 was primarily driven by lower significant litigation-related charges and higher gains on divestitures (net of divestiture-related restructuring actions) year-on-year. These items are further described in the \n\nCertain amounts adjusted for special items -\u00a0(non-GAAP measures)\n\n section above. A number of factors impact the various income statement line items. Expanded discussion of each of the income statement line items follows in the various sections below. \n\n\u200b\n\nIn 2020 the Company\u2019s operating expenses were impacted by factors described in the preceding Overview \u2013 Consideration of COVID-19 section above. \n\n\u200b\n\nIn 2020 and 2019, 3M approved and committed to certain restructuring actions that impacted cost of sales, SG&A, and R&D (see Note 5 for additional details). In addition to actions related to divestitures (as discussed earlier in the \n\nCertain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures)\n\n section), for 2020 these included charges to address certain COVID-related impacts and actions to further enhance its operational and marketing capabilities. In 2019, charges included actions in light of slower than expected 2019 sales and associated with realigning its organizational structure and operating model.\n\n\u200b\n\nPension and postretirement service cost expense is recorded in cost of sales, SG&A, and R&D. In total, 3M\u2019s defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense increased $31 million in 2020. Refer to Note 13 (Pension and Postretirement Plans) for the service cost components of net periodic benefit costs.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe Company is investing in an initiative called business transformation, with these investments impacting cost of sales, SG&A, and R&D. Business transformation encompasses the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis, as well as changes in processes and internal/external service delivery across 3M.\n\n\u200b\n\nCost of Sales:\n\n\u200b\n\nCost of sales includes manufacturing, engineering and freight costs. \n\n\u200b\n\nCost of sales, measured as a percent of sales, decreased during 2020 when compared to 2019. Decreases were related to lower significant litigation-related charges taken in 2020, which were partially offset by 2020 COVID-related net impacts, including period expenses of unabsorbed manufacturing costs, in addition to higher restructuring action charges taken in 2020 along with certain related follow-on accelerated depreciation. In addition, selling prices increased year-on-year by 0.6 percent for full year 2020, and lower raw material costs reduced cost of sales as a percentage of sales.\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n29\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses:\n\n\u200b\n\nSG&A in dollars decreased slightly in 2020 when compared to 2019. The decrease was driven by cost saving actions taken in response to COVID-19, in addition to benefits from prior year restructuring (and adjustments thereto in 2020). Additional factors that decreased SG&A in 2020 also include lower year-on-year impact related to significant litigation-related charges. In terms of SG&A as a percent of sales, partially offsetting these decreases was the overall effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on sales that resulted in higher costs as a percent of sales. SG&A was also impacted by increased spending year-on-year related to Acelity, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2019.\n\n\u200b\n\nResearch, Development and Related Expenses:\n\n \n\n\u200b\n\nR&D in dollars decreased slightly in 2020 when compared to 2019 and remained relatively consistent as a percent of sales at 5.8% in 2020 compared to 5.9% in 2019. 3M continued to invest in its key initiatives, including R&D aimed at disruptive innovation programs with the potential to create entirely new markets and disrupt existing markets. Incremental R&D spending in 2020 included activities related to the Acelity business acquired in the fourth quarter of 2019. 3M also experienced lower year-on-year restructuring activities impacting R&D.\n\n\u200b\n\nGain on Sale of Businesses:\n\n\u200b\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $2 million ($1 million loss after tax) related to the sale of its advanced ballistic-protection business and recognition of certain contingent consideration. During the second quarter of 2020, the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $387 million ($304 after tax) related to the sale of substantially all of its drug delivery business. \n\n\u200b\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, the Company sold certain oral care technology comprising a business and reflected an earnout on a previous divestiture resulting in a pre-tax gain of $8 million ($7 million gain after tax). In the third quarter of 2019, 3M recorded a gain related to the divestiture of the Company\u2019s gas and flame detection business and an immaterial impact as a result of measuring a disposal group at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell, which in aggregate resulted in a pre-tax gain of $106 million ($79 million after tax). Refer to Note 3 for additional details on divestitures.\n\n\u200b\n\nOperating Income Margin:\n\n\u200b\n\n3M uses operating income as one of its primary business segment performance measurement tools.

Partially offsetting this net decrease were year-on-year net gains related to certain property sales (in 2020 with Safety and Industrial and in 2019 within Corporate and Unallocated) in addition to benefits recognized in 2020 related to the restructuring and other actions taken in 2019 (and the adjustments thereto in 2020) along with continued cost management and productivity efforts.\n\n\u25cf\n\nOperating income margins decreased year-on-year due to higher defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense.\n\n\u200b\n\nNon divestiture-related restructuring actions:\n\n\u25cf\n\n3M recorded non divestiture-related restructuring charges that impacted operating income aggregating $195 million in 2020.

The increase in 2019 was driven by higher U.S. average debt balances, partially offset by the year-on-year increase in interest income driven by higher balances in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities during the year resulting from the proceeds from debt issuances in advance of the October 2019 Acelity acquisition. \n\n\u200b\n\nIn addition, other expense (income) was impacted by lower year-on-year pension and postretirement net periodic benefit non-service benefits for 2020 and 2019, respectively. The lower year-on-year benefit in 2020 was primarily due to the increased expense from lower December 31, 2019 discount rates. The decreases in 2019 was primarily due to the charge associated with the voluntary retirement program taken in the second quarter of 2019 in addition to the pension settlement charges in the fourth quarter of 2019 related to employee retirements.\u00a0Refer to Note 13 for additional details. \n\n\u200b\n\nProvision for Income Taxes:\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n(Percent\u00a0of\u00a0pre-tax\u00a0income)\n\n\u200b\n\n2020\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEffective tax rate \n\n\u200b\n\n 19.6\n\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\n 19.8\n\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u200b\n\nThe effective tax rate for 2020 was 19.6 percent, a decrease of 0.2 percentage points when compared to 2019.

In addition, disclosures relating to 3M\u2019s business segments are provided in Note 19. Effective in the first quarter of 2020, the Company changed its business segment reporting in its continuing effort to improve the alignment of businesses around markets. Also, effective in the second quarter of 2020, the measure of segment operating performance used by 3M\u2019s chief operating decision maker (CODM) changed and, as a result, 3M\u2019s disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income) has been updated for all periods presented. The change to business segment operating income aligns with the update to how the CODM assesses performance and allocates resources for the Company\u2019s business segments.\n\n\u200b\n\nAs discussed in Note 19, 3M discloses business segment operating income as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income and income before taxes. Business segment operating income includes dual credit for certain related operating income (as described below in \u201cElimination of Dual Credit\u201d). Business segment operating income excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in \u201cCorporate and Unallocated\u201d). Additionally, the following special items are excluded from business segment operating income and, instead, are included within Corporate and Unallocated: significant litigation-related charges/benefits, gain/loss on sale of businesses, and divestiture-related restructuring actions. \n\n\u200b\n\nInformation provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. 3M manages its operations in four business segments. The reportable segments are Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer.\n\n\u200b\n\nCorporate and Unallocated:\n\n\u200b\n\nIn addition to these four business segments, 3M assigns certain costs to \u201cCorporate and Unallocated,\u201d which is presented separately in the preceding business segments table and in Note 19. Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, such as corporate investment gains and losses, certain derivative gains and losses, certain insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and environmental expenses, corporate restructuring charges and certain under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension, stock-based compensation) that the Company determines not to allocate directly to its business segments. Additionally, Corporate and Unallocated operating income includes special items such as significant litigation-related charges/benefits, gain/loss on sale of businesses, and divestiture-related restructuring costs. Corporate and Unallocated also includes sales, costs, and income from contract manufacturing, transition services and other arrangements with the acquirer of the Communication Markets Division following its 2018 divestiture through 2019 and the acquirer of the former drug delivery business following its 2020 divestiture. Because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.\n\n\u200b\n\nCorporate and Unallocated net operating loss decreased by $767 million in 2020 when compared to 2019. \n\n\u200b\n\nSpecial Items\n\nRefer to the \n\nCertain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures)\n\n section and Note 5 for additional details on the impact of significant litigation-related charges/benefits, gain/loss on sale of businesses, and divestiture-related restructuring actions that are reflected in Corporate and Unallocated.\n\n \n\n\u200b\n\nOther Corporate Expense - Net\n\nOther corporate operating expenses increased in 2020. The increases were due to year-over-year increased net costs as a result of the regular review of 3M\u2019s respirator mask liabilities, lower year-on-year gains from certain property sales reflected in Corporate and Unallocated, in addition to transition service and other arrangement costs, net of income, post-divestiture of the Company\u2019s former drug delivery business in 2020, and increased legal expenses. These increases were partially offset by lower year-on-year non divestiture-related restructuring costs reflected in Corporate and Unallocated. \n\n\u200b\n\n34\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOperating Business Segments:\n\n\u200b\n\nInformation related to 3M\u2019s business segments is presented in the tables that follow. Organic local-currency sales include both organic volume impacts plus selling price impacts. Acquisition impacts, if any, are measured separately for the first twelve months post-transaction. The divestiture impacts, if any, foreign currency translation impacts and total sales change are also provided for each business segment.

Export sales are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3M customers are made. A portion of the products or components sold by 3M\u2019s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas. As customers move their operations from one geographic area to another, 3M\u2019s results will follow.

The above table includes the impact of acquisitions (which involved approximately 5,500 positions in 2019), net of divestitures and other actions. \n\n\u200b\n\nCapital Spending/Net Property, Plant and Equipment:\n\n\u200b\n\nInvestments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. In 2020, 63 percent of 3M\u2019s capital spending was within the Americas, followed by Europe, Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific. 3M is increasing its investment in manufacturing and sourcing capability in order to more closely align its product capability with its sales in major geographic areas in order to best serve its customers throughout the world with proprietary, automated, efficient, safe and sustainable processes. Capital spending is discussed in more detail later in MD&A in the section entitled \u201cCash Flows from Investing Activities.\u201d\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMA\n\nTES\n\n\u200b\n\nInformation regarding significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements. As stated in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe Company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings, pension and postretirement obligations, goodwill and certain long-lived assets, and uncertainty in income tax positions. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of 3M\u2019s Board of Directors.\n\n\u200b\n\nLegal Proceedings:\n\n\u200b\n\nAssessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The Company accrues an estimated liability for legal proceeding claims that are both probable and estimable in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 450, \n\nContingencies\n\n. Please refer to the section entitled \u201cProcess for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities Related to Legal Proceedings\u201d (contained in \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Note 16) for additional information about such estimates.\n\n\u200b\n\nPension and Postretirement Obligations:\n\n\u200b\n\nThe Company makes certain estimates and judgements in relation to its defined benefit pension and postretirement obligations. \n\n\u200b\n\nThe benefit obligation represents the present value of the benefits that employees are entitled to in the future for services already rendered as of the measurement date. The Company measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting benefit payment cash flows for each future period and discounting these cash flows back to the December 31 measurement date, using the yields of a \n\n40\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nportfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Service cost and interest cost are measured separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. Service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income.\n\n\u200b\n\nUsing this methodology, the Company determined discount rates for its plans as follow:\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nU.S. Qualified Pension\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nInternational Pension (weighted average)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nU.S. Postretirement Medical\n\n\u200b\n\nDecember\u00a031, 2020 Liability:\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nBenefit obligation\n\n\u200b\n\n 2.55\n\n%\n\n 1.38\n\n%\n\n 2.35\n\n%\n\n2021 Net Periodic Benefit Cost Components:\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nService cost\n\n\u200b\n\n 2.84\n\n%\n\n 1.23\n\n%\n\n 2.71\n\n%\n\nInterest cost\n\n\u200b\n\n 1.93\n\n%\n\n 1.13\n\n%\n\n 1.68\n\n%\n\n\u200b\n\nAnother significant element in determining the Company\u2019s pension expense is the expected return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets for the primary U.S. qualified pension plan is based on strategic asset allocation of the plan, long-term capital market return expectations, and expected performance from active investment management. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2021 is 6.50%, a decrease from 6.75% in 2020. Return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions. The weighted average expected return for the international pension plans is 4.36% for 2021 compared to 4.70% for 2020. Refer to Note 13 for information on how the 2020 rates were determined.\n\n\u200b\n\n3M follows ASC 820, \n\nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures\n\n in determining the fair value of plan assets within the Company\u2019s pension and postretirement benefit plans. While the Company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. See Note\u00a013 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining defined benefit pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.\n\n\u200b\n\nFor the year ended December\u00a031, 2020, the Company recognized consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement service cost expense of $456 million and a benefit of $50 million related to all non-service pension and postretirement net benefit costs (after settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) for a total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of $406 million, up from $357\u00a0million in 2019. \n\n\u200b\n\nIn 2021, defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense is anticipated to total approximately $497 million while non-service pension and postretirement net benefit costs is anticipated to be a benefit of approximately $130 million, for a total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of $367 million, a decrease of approximately $40 million compared to 2020.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe table below summarizes the impact on 2021 pension expense for the U.S. and international pension plans of a 0.25 percentage point increase/decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions used to measure plan liabilities and 2020 net periodic benefit cost.

Those include considerations made in the valuation of certain acquired identifiable definite-lived and indefinite-lived assets as a result of business combinations as well as considerations in the recoverability and impairment assessments of long-lived assets and goodwill.\n\n\u200b\n\nAcquisition of certain identifiable definite-lived and indefinite-lived assets\n\n\u200b\n\nIn conjunction with an acquisition of a business, the Company records identifiable definite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired at their respective fair values as of the date of acquisition. The corresponding fair value estimates for these assets acquired include projected future cash flows, associated discount rates used to calculate present value, asset life cycles, royalty rates, and customer retention rates. The fair value calculated for indefinite-lived intangible assets such as certain tradenames, in addition to intangible assets that are definite-lived such as patents, customer relationships, tradenames and other technology-based assets may change during the finalization of the purchase price allocation, due to the significant estimates used in determining their fair value. As a result, the Company may make adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded for certain items as part of the purchase price allocation subsequent to the acquisition, not to exceed one year after the acquisition date, until the purchase accounting allocation is finalized.\n\n\u200b\n\nAssessments of long-lived assets and goodwill\n\n\u200b\n\nAs of December\u00a031, 2020, net property, plant and equipment totaled $9.4 billion and net identifiable intangible assets totaled $5.8 billion, of which $0.7 billion related to indefinite-lived tradenames. In addition, 3M goodwill totaled approximately $13.8 billion as of December\u00a031, 2020. Long-lived assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows from the asset\u2019s or asset group\u2019s ongoing use and eventual disposition. If an impairment is identified, the amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset\u2019s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. Intangible assets with an indefinite life, namely certain tradenames, are not amortized. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and are tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. An impairment loss would be recognized when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, as further discussed below, and is tested between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. If future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3M would expect that only a portion of the long-lived assets or goodwill would be impaired. \n\nManagement makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time. This includes the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses. These estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. For instance, expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group. Factors which could result in future impairment charges include, among others, changes in worldwide economic conditions, changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These risk factors are discussed in Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d of this document. In addition, changes in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing results.\n\n\u200b\n\nAs of December\u00a031, 2020, the $0.7 billion of indefinite-lived tradenames primarily relates to Capital Safety (acquired in 2015), whose tradenames ($520 million at acquisition date) have been in existence for over 60 years (refer to Note 4 for more detail). The primary valuation technique used in estimating the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets (tradenames) is a discounted cash flow approach. Specifically, a relief of royalty rate is applied to estimated sales, with the resulting amounts then discounted using an appropriate market/technology discount rate. The relief of royalty rate is the estimated royalty rate a market participant would pay to acquire the right to market/produce the product. In the first quarter of 2020, 3M reflected an immaterial charge related to impairment of certain indefinite-lived assets in 2020. Based on annual impairment testing in the third quarter of 2020, no additional impairment was indicated. \n\n\u200b\n\n3M goodwill totaled approximately $13.8 billion as of December\u00a031, 2020. 3M\u2019s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of each year. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but are required to be combined when reporting units \n\n42\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nwithin the same segment have similar economic characteristics. At 3M, reporting units correspond to a division. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit\u2019s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, and the loss would equal that difference. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3M typically uses the price/earnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows. 3M uses the discounted cash flow approach for start-up, loss position and declining businesses, in addition to using for businesses where the price/earnings ratio valuation method indicates additional review is warranted. 3M also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions. Where applicable, 3M uses a weighted-average discounted cash flow analysis for certain divisions, using projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions, among other factors. The weighting was based on management\u2019s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring.\n\n\u200b\n\nAs described in Note 19, effective in the first quarter of 2020, the Company changed its business segment reporting. For any product changes that resulted in reporting unit changes, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units, the results of which were immaterial. In conjunction with the change in segment reporting, 3M completed an assessment indicating no goodwill impairment existed as a result of this new segment structure. The discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2020 annual impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time.\n\n\u200b\n\nBased on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2020, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units.\n\n \n\nAs of October\u00a01, 2020, 3M had 22 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 93 percent of the goodwill. These ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: Advanced Materials, Display Materials and Systems, Electronics Materials Solutions, Health Information Systems,\u00a0Industrial Adhesives and Tapes,\u00a0Medical Solutions, Oral Care Solutions, Personal Safety, Separation and Purification Sciences, and Transportation Safety.\n\n\u200b\n\n3M is a highly integrated enterprise, where businesses share technology and leverage common fundamental strengths and capabilities, thus many of 3M\u2019s businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3M\u2019s focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3M\u2019s value being comprised of internally developed businesses that have no goodwill associated with them. \n\n\u200b\n\n3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2021 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment.\n\n\u200b\n\nUncertainty in Income Tax Positions:\n\n\u200b\n\nThe extent of 3M\u2019s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The Company follows guidance provided by ASC 740,\u00a0\n\nIncome Taxes\n\n, a subset of which relates to uncertainty in income taxes, to record these liabilities (refer to Note 10 for additional information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company\u2019s current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the Company\u2019s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary.\n\n\u200b\n\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEM\n\nENTS\n\n\u200b\n\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n\u200b\n\n43\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDI\n\nTY\n\n\u200b\n\nThe strength and stability of 3M\u2019s business model and strong free cash flow capability, together with proven capital markets access, provides financial flexibility and enables the Company to invest through business cycles. Investing in 3M\u2019s business to drive organic growth and deliver strong returns on invested capital remains the first priority for capital deployment. This includes research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. Organic investments will be supplemented by complementary acquisitions. The Company also continues to actively manage its portfolio to maximize value for shareholders. Given uncertainty arising from COVID-19, the Company suspended repurchases under its board-approved share repurchase program effective March 2020 with other repurchase activity limited to 3M\u2019s stock compensation plans. 3M will continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and plans to resume share repurchases in 2021. 3M maintains strong liquidity and further added to its liquidity position through the issuance of $1.75 billion in registered notes in March 2020. To fund cash needs in the United States, the Company relies on ongoing cash flow from U.S. operations, access to capital markets and repatriation of the earnings of its foreign affiliates that are not considered to be permanently reinvested. For those international earnings still considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. See Note 10 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.\n\n\u200b\n\n3M\u2019s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3M\u2019s commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. At December\u00a031, 2020, there was no commercial paper issued and outstanding.\n\n\u200b\n\nTotal Debt:\n\n\u200b\n\nThe strength of 3M\u2019s credit profile and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company\u2019s debt maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. 3M currently has an A1 credit rating with a negative outlook from Moody\u2019s Investors Service and an A+ credit rating with negative outlook from Standard and Poor\u2019s.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe Company\u2019s total debt was $1.5 billion lower at December\u00a031, 2020 when compared to December\u00a031, 2019. Decreases in debt are further described in Note 12 and include the repayment of aggregate $445 million principal amount of Third Lien Notes subject to in-substance defeasance, 650 million euros and $500 million aggregate principal amount of floating-rate medium-term notes that matured, the December 2020 repayment of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of notes related to make-whole-call offers, lower commercial paper balance, and the repayment of the 80 billion Japanese yen and 150 million euro credit facilities. These decreases were partially offset by the March 2020 issuance of $1.75 billion of registered notes. For discussion of repayments of and proceeds from debt refer to the following \u201cCash Flows from Financing Activities\u201d section.\n\n\u200b\n\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it would no longer require banks to submit rates for the London InterBank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) after 2021. In November 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA), LIBOR\u2019s administrator, proposed extending the publication of USD LIBOR through June 2023. The Company has reviewed its debt securities, bank facilities, and derivative instruments and continues to evaluate commercial contracts that may utilize LIBOR as the reference rate. 3M will continue its assessment and monitor regulatory developments during the transition period.\n\n\u200b\n\nEffective February 10, 2020, the Company updated its \u201cwell-known seasoned issuer\u201d (WKSI) shelf registration statement, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future issuance and sale. This replaced 3M\u2019s previous shelf registration dated February 24, 2017. In May 2016, in connection with the WKSI shelf, 3M entered into an amended and restated distribution agreement relating to the future issuance and sale (from time to time) of the Company\u2019s medium-term notes program (Series F), up to the aggregate principal amount of $18 billion, which was an increase from the previous aggregate principal amount up to $9 billion of the same Series.\n\n\u200b\n\nAs of December\u00a031, 2020, the total amount of debt issued as part of the medium-term notes program (Series F), inclusive of debt issued in February 2019 and prior years is approximately $17.6 billion (utilizing the foreign exchange rates applicable at the time of issuance for the euro denominated debt). Additionally, the August 2019 and March 2020 debt was issued under the WKSI shelf registration, but not as part of the medium-term notes program (Series F). Information with respect to long-term debt issuances and maturities for the periods presented is included in Note 12.\n\n44\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe Company has a $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in November 2024. The revolving credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to $1.0 billion (at lender\u2019s discretion), bringing the total facility up to $4.0 billion. In addition, 3M entered into a $1.25 billion 364-day credit facility, which was renewed in November 2020 with an expiration date of November 2021. The 364-day credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may convert any advances outstanding on the maturity date into term loans with a maturity date one year later. These credit facilities were undrawn at December\u00a031, 2020. Under both the $3.0 billion and $1.25 billion credit agreements, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At December\u00a031, 2020, this ratio was approximately 17 to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends.\n\n\u200b\n\nApart from the committed credit facilities described above, in September 2019, 3M entered into a credit facility initially expiring in July 2020 that was further extended to August 2021 in the amount of 80 billion Japanese yen. In November 2019, 3M entered into a credit facility expiring in November 2020 in the amount of 150 million euros. During the third quarter of 2020, the Company paid the outstanding balances and closed these credit facilities. The Company also had $273 million in stand-alone letters of credit and bank guarantees issued and outstanding at December\u00a031, 2020. These instruments are utilized in connection with normal business activities.\n\n\u200b\n\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities:\n\n\u200b\n\nAt December\u00a031, 2020, 3M had $5.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $2.8 billion was held by the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries and approximately $2.3 billion was held by the United States. These balances are invested in bank instruments and other high-quality fixed income securities. At December\u00a031, 2019, 3M had $2.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $2.4 billion was held by the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries and approximately $100 million was held by the United States. The increase from December 31, 2019 primarily resulted from strong cash flow from operations, reduced capital expenditures, and lower share repurchases.\u00a0\n\n\u200b\n\nNet Debt (non-GAAP measure):\n\n\u200b\n\nNet debt is not defined under U.S. GAAP and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines net debt as total debt less the total of cash, cash equivalents and current and long-term marketable securities. 3M believes net debt is meaningful to investors as 3M considers net debt and its components to be important indicators of liquidity and financial position.

Working capital is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines working capital as current assets minus current liabilities. 3M believes working capital is meaningful to investors as a measure of operational efficiency and short-term financial health. \n\n\u200b\n\nWorking capital increased $3.3 billion compared with December\u00a031, 2019. Balance changes in current assets increased working capital by $2.0 billion, driven by increases in cash and cash equivalents and inventory, partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable. Balance changes in current liabilities increased working capital by $1.3 billion, primarily due to decreases in short-term borrowing and the current portion of long-term debt. \n\n\u200b\n\nAccounts receivable decreased $86 million from December\u00a031, 2019, primarily due to ongoing collection management and increased expected credit losses on customer receivables related to COVID-19 uncertainty. Inventory increased $105 million from December\u00a031, 2019 primarily as a result of foreign currency impacts. These increases were partially offset by inventory decreases as a result of the divestiture of the drug delivery business.\n\n\u200b\n\nReturn on Invested Capital (non-GAAP measure):\n\n\u200b\n\nReturn on Invested Capital (ROIC) is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Therefore, ROIC should not be considered a substitute for other measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines ROIC as adjusted net income (net income including non-controlling interest plus after-tax interest expense) divided by average invested capital (equity plus debt). The Company believes ROIC is meaningful to investors as it focuses on shareholder value creation. The calculation is provided in the below table.\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n46\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIn 2020, ROIC of 18.2 percent was higher than 2019. The increase was driven by the lower year-over-year impact of significant litigation-related charges in addition to the non-repeating charge from the 2019 deconsolidation of the Company\u2019s Venezuela subsidiary. 2019 ROIC was also negatively impacted by the increase in cash and cash equivalents in anticipation of the funding of the acquisition of Acelity. \n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nYears ended December\u00a031\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u200b\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u200b\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n(Millions)\n\n\u200b\n\n2020\n\n\u200b\n\n2019\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nReturn on Invested Capital (non-GAAP measure)\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nNet income including non-controlling interest\n\n\u200b\n\n$\n\n 5,388\n\n\u200b\n\n$\n\n 4,582\n\n\u200b\n\nInterest expense (after-tax) (1)\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n 425\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n 359\n\n\u200b\n\nAdjusted net income (Return)\n\n\u200b\n\n$\n\n 5,813\n\n\u200b\n\n$\n\n 4,941\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nAverage shareholders' equity (including non-controlling interest) (2)\n\n\u200b\n\n$\n\n 11,500\n\n\u200b\n\n$\n\n 10,198\n\n\u200b\n\nAverage short-term and long-term debt (3)\n\n\u200b\n\n\u00a0\n\n 20,413\n\n\u200b\n\n\u00a0\n\n 17,982\n\n\u200b\n\nAverage invested capital\n\n\u200b\n\n$\n\n 31,913\n\n\u200b\n\n$\n\n 28,180\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nReturn on invested capital (non-GAAP measure)\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n 18.2\n\n%\n\n\u200b\n\n 17.5\n\n%\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n(1) Effective income tax rate used for interest expense\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n 19.6\n\n%\n\n\u200b\n\n 19.8\n\n%\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n(2) Calculation of average equity (includes non-controlling interest)\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nEnding total equity as of:\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nMarch 31\n\n\u200b\n\n$\n\n 10,209\n\n\u200b\n\n$\n\n 9,757\n\n\u200b\n\nJune 30\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n 10,915\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n 10,142\n\n\u200b\n\nSeptember 30\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n 11,943\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n 10,764\n\n\u200b\n\nDecember 31\n\n\u200b\n\n\u00a0\n\n 12,931\n\n\u200b\n\n\u00a0\n\n 10,126\n\n\u200b\n\nAverage total equity\n\n\u200b\n\n$\n\n 11,500\n\n\u200b\n\n$\n\n 10,198\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n(3) Calculation of average debt\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nEnding short-term and long-term debt as of:\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nMarch 31\n\n\u200b\n\n$\n\n 22,495\n\n\u200b\n\n$\n\n 16,370\n\n\u200b\n\nJune 30\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n 20,762\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n 15,806\n\n\u200b\n\nSeptember 30\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n 19,598\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n 19,439\n\n\u200b\n\nDecember 31\n\n\u200b\n\n\u00a0\n\n 18,795\n\n\u200b\n\n\u00a0\n\n 20,313\n\n\u200b\n\nAverage short-term and long-term debt\n\n\u200b\n\n$\n\n 20,413\n\n\u200b\n\n$\n\n 17,982\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nCash Flows:\n\n\u200b\n\nCash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are provided in the tables that follow.

Costs related to maintenance, ordinary repairs, and certain other items are expensed. 3M also invests in growth, which adds to capacity, driven by new products, both through expansion of current facilities and new facilities. Finally, 3M also invests in other initiatives, such as information technology (IT), laboratory facilities, and a continued focus on investments in sustainability.\n\n48\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nRefer to Note 3 for information on acquisitions and divestitures. The Company is actively considering additional acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances, and from time to time may also divest certain businesses. Acquisitions, net of cash acquired, in 2020 primarily relate to the payment made for contingent consideration in regards to the Acelity acquisition. Proceeds from sale of businesses in 2020 primarily relate to the sales of the Company\u2019s advanced ballistic-protection business and its drug delivery business. Acquisitions, net of cash acquired, in 2019 primarily include the purchase of M*Modal and Acelity Inc. Proceeds from sale of businesses in 2019 primarily relate to the sale of certain oral care technology comprising a business and the gas and flame detection business.\n\n\u200b\n\nPurchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments are primarily attributable to certificates of deposit/time deposits, commercial paper, and other securities, which are classified as available-for-sale. In 2020 these included the maturity of the held-to-maturity debt security that was purchased to satisfy the redemption of the Third Lien Notes (which matured in May 2020).

Repayment of debt primarily consists of the aggregate $445 million principal amount of Third Lien Notes and the 650 million euros and $500 million aggregate principal amount of floating-rate medium-term notes that matured in May 2020 and August 2020, respectively.\u00a0During the third quarter of 2020, the Company paid the outstanding balances on their Japanese yen and euro credit facilities. In addition, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes maturing in September 2021 were repaid in December 2020 via make-whole-call offers.\n\n \n\nIncreases in debt were related to the March 2020 issuance of $1.75 billion in registered notes. There was no outstanding commercial paper at December\u00a031, 2020, as compared to $150 million at December\u00a031, 2019.

Increases in debt related to the first quarter and third quarter 2019 issuances of $2.25 billion of medium-term notes and $3.25 billion of other registered notes, respectively, 69 billion Japanese yen (approximately $632 million at December 31, 2019 exchange rates) outstanding from the 80 billion Japanese yen credit facility established in September 2019, 150 million euros (approximately $168 million at December 31, 2019 exchange rates) outstanding credit facility established in November 2019, and $0.5 billion of debt assumed and not yet repaid as a result of the Company\u2019s acquisition of Acelity Inc. Repayment of debt primarily consists of the June 2019 repayment of $625 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium-term notes that had matured, in addition to debt assumed and subsequently repaid as a result of the Company\u2019s acquisitions of M*Modal and Acelity Inc. as discussed in Note 3. Outstanding commercial paper decreased $285 million from December 31, 2018 to  December 31, 2019.

In November\u00a02018, 3M\u2019s Board of Directors replaced the Company\u2019s February 2016 repurchase program with a new repurchase program. This new program authorizes the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M\u2019s outstanding common stock, with no pre-established end date. In 2020, the Company purchased $0.4 billion of its own stock, compared to purchases of $1.4 billion in 2019. As of December\u00a031, 2020, approximately $7.8 billion remained available under the authorization. In the first quarter of 2020, the Company suspended repurchases under its board-approved share repurchase program with other repurchase activity limited to 3M\u2019s stock compensation plans. The Company plans to resume share purchases in 2021. For more information, refer to the table titled \u201cIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\u201d in Part\u00a0II,\u00a0Item 5. The Company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the Company\u2019s stock.\n\n\u200b\n\nDividends Paid to Shareholders:\n\n\u200b\n\nCash dividends paid to shareholders totaled $3.388 billion ($5.88 per share) in 2020, $3.316 billion ($5.76 per share) in 2019, and $3.193 billion ($5.44 per share) in 2018. 3M has paid dividends since 1916. In February\u00a02021, 3M\u2019s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2021 dividend of $1.48 per share, an increase of 1 percent. This is equivalent to an annual dividend of $5.92 per share and marked the 63\n\nrd\n\n consecutive year of dividend increases.\n\n\u200b\n\nOther cash flows from financing activities may include various other items, such as cash paid associated with certain derivative instruments, distributions to or sales of noncontrolling interests, changes in cash overdraft balances, and principal payments for finance leases.\n\n\u200b\n\nFree Cash Flow (non-GAAP measure):\n\n\u200b\n\nFree cash flow and free cash flow conversion are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, they should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The Company defines free cash flow conversion as free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3M. The Company believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are meaningful to investors as they are useful measures of performance and the Company uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash. The first quarter of each year is typically 3M\u2019s seasonal low for free cash flow and free cash flow conversion. Below find a recap of free cash flow and free cash flow conversion. \n\n\u200b\n\nRefer to the preceding \u201cCash Flows from Operating Activities\u201d and \u201cCash Flows from Investing Activities\u201d sections for discussion of items that impacted the operating cash flow and purchases of PP&E components of the calculation of free cash flow.

See Note 10 for additional details.\n\n\u200b\n\nUnconditional purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company. Included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts, capital commitments, service agreements and utilities. These estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with \n\n51\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nterms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year. Many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3M guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers. The Company expects to receive consideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. Contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table, but these commitments represent a small part of the Company\u2019s expected capital spending. The purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future but represent only those items for which the Company is contractually obligated. The majority of 3M\u2019s products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional commitment. For this reason, these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the Company\u2019s expected future cash outflows on a stand-alone basis.\n\n\u200b\n\nOther obligations, included in the preceding table within the caption entitled \u201cUnconditional purchase obligations and other\u201d include the current portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under ASC 740, which is expected to be paid out in cash in the next 12 months, when applicable. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term payments, or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time; therefore, the long-term portion of the total net tax liability of $933 million is excluded from the preceding table. In addition, the transition tax prescribed under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) is separately included in the table above. Refer to Note 10 for further details. Additionally, included within the caption entitled \u201cUnconditional purchase obligations and other\u201d are operating lease commitments that have not yet commenced, which as of December\u00a031, 2020, totaled approximately $18 million. These commitments pertain to 3M\u2019s right of use buildings.\n\n\u200b\n\nAs discussed in Note 13, the Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2021 and Company contributions to its U.S. and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in future years; therefore, amounts related to these plans are not included in the preceding table.\n\n\u200b\n\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMEN\n\nTS\n\n\u200b\n\nThe Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and to offset, in part, the impacts of changes in value of various non-functional currency denominated items including certain intercompany financing balances. The Company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts and price protection agreements.\n\n\u200b\n\nRefer to Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d, for further discussion of foreign exchange rates risk, interest rates risk, commodity prices risk and value at risk analysis.\n\n\u200b", "item7a": ">Item 7A. \n\nQuantitative\n\n and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\n\n\u200b\n\nIn the context of Item 7A, 3M is exposed to market risk due to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Changes in those factors could impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. Senior management provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities, determines certain of the Company\u2019s financial risk policies and objectives, and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization. Senior management also establishes certain associated procedures relative to control and valuation, risk analysis, counterparty credit approval, and ongoing monitoring and reporting.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and forward and option contracts. However, the Company\u2019s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties.\n\n\u200b\n\nForeign Exchange Rates Risk:\n\n\u200b\n\nForeign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company\u2019s net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. 3M is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the U.S. dollar. The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the \n\n52\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\neffect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. 3M may dedesignate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction. The maximum length of time over which 3M hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions is 36 months. In addition, 3M enters into foreign currency contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset, in part, the impacts of changes in value of various non-functional currency denominated items including certain intercompany financing balances. As circumstances warrant, the Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency denominated debt as hedging instruments to hedge portions of the Company\u2019s net investments in foreign operations. The dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the Company\u2019s foreign exchange forward and option contracts designated as either cash flow hedges or net investment hedges was $2.3 billion at December 31, 2020. The dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the Company\u2019s foreign exchange forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments was $3.2 billion at December 31, 2020. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, the Company had 3.5 billion Euros in principal amount of foreign currency denominated debt designated as non-derivative hedging instruments in certain net investment hedges as discussed in Note 14 in the \u201cNet Investment Hedges\u201d section.\n\n\u200b\n\nInterest Rates Risk:\n\n\u200b\n\nThe Company may be impacted by interest rate volatility with respect to existing debt and future debt issuances. 3M manages interest rate risk and expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. In addition, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The dollar equivalent (based on inception date foreign currency exchange rates) gross notional amount of the Company\u2019s interest rate swaps at December\u00a031, 2020 was $403 million. Additional details about 3M\u2019s long-term debt can be found in Note 12, including references to information regarding derivatives and/or hedging instruments, further discussed in Note 14, associated with the Company\u2019s long-term debt.\n\n\u200b\n\nCommodity Prices Risk:\n\n\u200b\n\nThe Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts and price protection agreements. The related mark-to-market gain or loss on qualifying hedges was included in other comprehensive income to the extent effective, and reclassified into cost of sales in the period during which the hedged transaction affected earnings. \n\n\u200b\n\nValue At Risk:\n\n\u200b\n\nThe value at risk analysis is performed annually to assess the Company\u2019s sensitivity to changes in currency rates, interest rates, and commodity prices. A Monte Carlo simulation technique was used to test the impact on after-tax earnings related to debt instruments, interest rate derivatives and underlying foreign exchange and commodity exposures outstanding at December\u00a031, 2020. The model (third-party bank dataset) used a 95 percent confidence level over a 12-month time horizon. The exposure to changes in currency rates model used nine currencies, interest rates related to two currencies, and commodity prices related to five commodities. This model does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the Company. This model does not include foreign currency hedges, because the Company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results. The following table summarizes the possible adverse and positive impacts to after-tax earnings related to these exposures.\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nAdverse\u00a0impact\u00a0on\u00a0after-tax\n\n\u200b\n\nPositive\u00a0impact\u00a0on\u00a0after-tax\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nearnings\n\n\u200b\n\nearnings\n\n\u00a0\n\n(Millions)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n2020\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n2020\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n2019\n\n\u00a0\n\nForeign exchange rates\n\n\u200b\n\n$\n\n (169)\n\n\u200b\n\n$\n\n (133)\n\n\u200b\n\n$\n\n 175\n\n\u200b\n\n$\n\n 137\n\n\u200b\n\nInterest rates\n\n\u200b\n\n\u00a0\n\n (1)\n\n\u200b\n\n\u00a0\n\n (11)\n\n\u200b\n\n\u00a0\n\n 2\n\n\u200b\n\n\u00a0\n\n 10\n\n\u200b\n\nCommodity prices\n\n\u200b\n\n\u00a0\n\n \u2014\n\n\u200b\n\n\u00a0\n\n (2)\n\n\u200b\n\n\u00a0\n\n \u2014\n\n\u200b\n\n\u00a0\n\n 1\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nAn analysis of the global exposures related to purchased components and materials is performed at each year-end.

Discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of Part\u00a0I,\u00a0Item 2, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.\u201d\n\n\u200b\n\n*\u00a0Results are impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic, political, regulatory, capital markets and other external conditions.\n\n The Company operates in more than 70 countries and derives approximately 60 percent of its revenues from outside the United States. The Company\u2019s business is subject to global competition and geopolitical risks and has been and will in the future be adversely affected by factors in the United States and other countries that are beyond its control, such as slower economic growth, disruptions in financial markets, economic downturns in the form of either contained or widespread recessionary conditions, inflation, elevated unemployment levels, sluggish or uneven recovery, government actions impacting international trade agreements, imposing trade restrictions such as tariffs, and retaliatory counter measures, government deficit reduction and other austerity measures in specific countries or regions, or in the various industries in which the Company operates; social, political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions; natural and other disasters, including public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, affecting the operations of the Company or its customers and suppliers; or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital, interest rates, tax rates, tax laws, or exchange control, ability to expatriate earnings and other regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Natural occurrences and human activities are increasingly releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, contributing to changes in the earth\u2019s climate. Climate change, as well as related environmental and social regulations, may negatively impact the Company or its customers and suppliers, in terms of availability and cost of natural resources, sources and supply of energy, product demand and manufacturing, and the health and well-being of individuals and communities in which we operate.\n\n\u200b\n\n* \n\nThe Company faces liabilities related to certain fluorochemicals, which could adversely impact our results.\n\nAs previously reported, the Company has been voluntarily cooperating with various local, state, federal (primarily the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)), and international agencies in their review of the environmental and health effects of a broad group of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances produced by the Company, collectively known as \u201cPFAS.\u201d The PFAS group contains several categories and classes of durable chemicals and materials with properties that include oil, water, temperature, chemical and fire resistance, as well as electrical insulating properties. The strength of the carbon-fluorine bond also means that these compounds do not easily degrade. These characteristics have made PFAS critical to the manufacture of electronic devices such as cell phones, tablets and semi-conductors. They are also used to help prevent infections in products like surgical gowns and drapes. Commercial aircraft and low-emissions vehicles also rely on PFAS technology.\u00a0PFAS compounds are manufactured by various companies, including 3M,\u00a0and are used in everyday products. As science and technology evolve and advance, and in response to evolving knowledge and the understanding that PFAS compounds had the potential to build up over time, 3M announced in 2000 that we would voluntarily phase out production of perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) globally as a precautionary measure. We phased out of materials used to produce certain repellants and surfactant products, with most of these activities in the U.S. completed by the end of 2002. Phased out products included Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) and coatings for food packaging, for example. 3M currently is defending lawsuits concerning various PFAS-related products and chemistries, and is subject to unasserted and asserted claims and governmental regulatory proceedings and inquiries related to the production and use of PFAS in a variety of jurisdictions, as discussed in Note 16, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies,\u201d within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. An adverse outcome in any one or more of these matters could be material to our financial results. For example, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $897 million, inclusive of legal fees and other related obligations, in the first quarter of 2018 with respect to the settlement of a matter brought by the State of Minnesota involving the presence of PFAS in the groundwater, surface \n\n10\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \n\nwater, fish or other aquatic life, and sediments in the state. Governmental inquiries or lawsuits involving PFAS could lead to our incurring liability for damages or other costs, civil or criminal proceedings, the imposition of fines and penalties, or other remedies, as well as restrictions on or added costs for our business operations going forward, including in the form of restrictions on discharges at our manufacturing facilities or otherwise. \n\n\u200b\n\n*\u00a0The Company\u2019s future results may be affected by various asserted and unasserted legal and regulatory proceedings and legal compliance risks, including those involving product liability, antitrust, intellectual property, environmental, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws, U.S. trade sanctions compliance, regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and similar foreign agencies, U.S. federal healthcare program-related laws and regulations including the False Claims Act, anti-kickback laws, the Sunshine Act, or other matters.\n\n The outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the Company\u2019s expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to reliably predict. Although the Company maintains general liability insurance, the amount of liability that may result from certain of these risks may not always be covered by, or could exceed, the applicable insurance coverage. Various factors or developments can lead the Company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period. In addition, negative publicity related to product liability, environmental, health and safety matters involving the Company may negatively impact the Company\u2019s reputation. For a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the Company and the associated accounting estimates, see the discussion in Note 16, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies,\u201d within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n\u200b\n\n*\u00a0The Company\u2019s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences.\n\n Demand for the Company\u2019s products, which impacts revenue and profit margins, is affected by (i)\u00a0the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products; (ii)\u00a0the Company\u2019s response to downward pricing to stay competitive; (iii)\u00a0changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in the Company\u2019s incentive programs, or the customer\u2019s ability to achieve incentive goals; (iv)\u00a0changes in customers\u2019 preferences for our products, including the success of products offered by our competitors, and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the Company\u2019s products; and (v) changes in the business environment related to disruptive technologies, such as artificial intelligence, block-chain, expanded analytics and other enhanced learnings from increasing volume of available data.\n\n\u200b\n\n*\u00a0Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company\u2019s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings. \n\nBecause the Company\u2019s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and approximately 60 percent of the Company\u2019s revenues are derived from outside the United States, the Company\u2019s results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the U.S. dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies.\n\n\u200b\n\n*\u00a0The Company\u2019s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings, including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market.\n\n This ability is subject to difficulties or delays in product development, such as the inability to identify viable new products, obtain adequate intellectual property protection, or gain market acceptance of new products. There are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful.\n\n\u200b\n\n*\u00a0The Company\u2019s future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components, compounds, raw materials and energy, including oil and natural gas and their derivatives, due to shortages, increased demand, supply interruptions, currency exchange risks, natural disasters and other factors.\n\n The Company depends on various components, compounds, raw materials, and energy (including oil and natural gas and their derivatives) supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products. Supplier relationships have been and could be interrupted in the future due to natural and other disasters and other events, or be terminated. Any sustained interruption in the Company\u2019s receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, while the Company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.\n\n\u200b\n\n11\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \n\n*\u00a0The Company employs information technology systems to support its business, including ongoing phased implementation of an ERP system as part of business transformation on a worldwide basis over the next several years. Security breaches and other disruptions to the Company\u2019s information technology infrastructure could interfere with the Company\u2019s operations, compromise information belonging to the Company or its customers, suppliers, and employees, exposing the Company to liability which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business and reputation. \n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company relies on centralized and local information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of businesses. Additionally, the Company collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and has access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. Despite our cybersecurity measures (including employee and third-party training, monitoring of networks and systems, patching, maintenance, and backup of systems and data), the Company\u2019s information technology networks and infrastructure are still potentially be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers, breaches, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, computer viruses, ransomware, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, service or cloud provider breaches, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. It is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended period, up to and including several years. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of vulnerabilities to the Company\u2019s information technology networks and infrastructure, none of them to date has had a material impact to the Company. There may be other challenges and risks as the Company upgrades and standardizes its ERP system on a worldwide basis. Any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruptions or shutdowns, and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. Although the Company maintains insurance coverage for various cybersecurity and business continuity risks, there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured.\n\n\u200b\n\n*\u00a0Acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies, and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results. \n\nThe Company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures and changes to its organizational structure. With respect to acquisitions, including, for example, the recently completed acquisition of Acelity, Inc. and its KCI subsidiaries (a leading global medical technology company), future results will be affected by the Company\u2019s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies. The Company realigned from five to four business segments, effective in April of 2019, to better serve its global customers and markets. Successful execution of the realignment and the associated adjustments of our portfolio and business operating model, as well as other organizational changes, will be important to the Company\u2019s future results.\n\n\u200b\n\n*\u00a0The Company\u2019s future results may be affected by its operational execution, including scenarios where the Company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated.\n\n The Company\u2019s financial results depend on the successful execution of its business operating plans. The Company utilizes various tools, such as Lean Six Sigma, and engages in ongoing global business transformation. Business transformation is defined as changes in processes and internal/external service delivery across 3M to move to more efficient business models to improve operational efficiency and productivity, while allowing 3M to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency. This is enabled by the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. There can be no assurance that all of the projected productivity improvements will be realized. Operational challenges, including those related to productivity improvements, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial conditions and results of operations.\n\n\u200b\n\n*\u00a0The Company's defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our results.\n\n The performance of financial markets and discount rates impact the Company's funding obligations under its defined benefit plans. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets, and legislative or regulatory changes relating to defined benefit plan funding may increase the Company's funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows.\n\n\u200b\n\n*\u00a0Change in the Company\u2019s credit ratings could increase cost of funding.\n\n The Company\u2019s credit ratings are important to 3M\u2019s cost of capital. The major rating agencies routinely evaluate the Company\u2019s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3M. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include financial strength, business and financial risk, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. 3M currently has an A1 credit rating with a stable outlook from Moody\u2019s Investors Service and has an AA- credit rating with Standard & Poor\u2019s; Standard & Poor\u2019s placed 3M on \u201cCreditWatch Negative\u201d in January 2020. The Company\u2019s credit ratings have served to lower 3M\u2019s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders. The addition of further leverage to the Company\u2019s capital structure could impact 3M\u2019s credit ratings in the future. Failure to maintain \n\n12\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \n\nstrong investment grade ratings would adversely affect the Company\u2019s cost of funding and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets.\n\n\u200b", "item1b": ">Item 1B. \n\nUnresolved Staff Comment\n\ns.\n\n\u200b\n\nNone.\n\n\u200b\n\nItem 2. \n\nPropertie\n\ns.\n\n\u200b\n\nIn the U.S., 3M\u2019s general offices, corporate research laboratories, and certain division laboratories are located in St. Paul, Minnesota.

These exclude the 2019 charge related to the deconsolidation of the Company\u2019s Venezuelan subsidiary, the 2018 and 2019 significant litigation-related charges, and the 2017 enactment and 2018 measurement period adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded related to the 2017 enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). These non-GAAP measures are further described and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the \n\nCertain amounts adjusted for impacts of significant litigation-related charges, deconsolidation of the Company\u2019s Venezuelan subsidiary, and enactment/measurement period adjustments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) -\u00a0(non-GAAP measures)\n\n section below.\n\n\u200b\n\nOn an adjusted basis, net income attributable to 3M was $5.322 billion, or $9.10 per diluted share for 2019 compared to $6.295 billion, or $10.46 per diluted share for 2018, a decrease of 13.0 percent on a per diluted share basis. \n\n\u200b\n\nFor 2019, while 3M experienced sales growth in its Consumer and Health Care segments, this was more than offset by declines in 3M\u2019s Safety and Industrial and Transportation and Electronics segments. These two businesses were impacted by softness in certain end markets (China, automotive and electronics) and channel inventory adjustments, particularly within Asia Pacific and the United States. Earnings were also impacted by second quarter restructuring actions taken to address lower sales volumes, as well as inventory reductions to drive improved cash flow. Further restructuring actions were taken in fourth quarter to realign 3M\u2019s organizational structure and operating model to improve growth and operational efficiency.\u00a0Partially offsetting these impacts were benefits in the second half of 2019 from the second quarter restructuring actions.\n\n\u200b\n\nAdditional discussion related to the components of the year-on-year change in earnings per diluted share follows:\n\n\u200b\n\n2018 divestiture of Communication Markets Division, net of related restructuring actions:\n\n\u25cf\n\nIn 2018, 3M completed the sale of substantially all of its Communication Markets Division and reflected a pre-tax gain of $509 million as a result of this divestiture and was reported within the Company\u2019s Safety and Industrial business\n\n. During 2018, management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions as further described in Note 5, related to addressing corporate functional costs following the Communication Markets Division divestiture resulting in a 2018 pre-tax charge of $127 million, net of adjustments for reductions in cost estimates of $10 million. The aggregate net impact of the gain on sale and related restructuring actions increased earnings per diluted share by 50 cents per diluted share for the full year 2018. \n\n\u200b\n\nOrganic growth/productivity and other: \n\n\u25cf\n\nNegative organic local-currency sales growth as a result of softness in certain end markets and channel inventory adjustments, along with actions taken by 3M in response to lower sales volumes and high inventory levels, which resulted in lower manufacturing and inventory absorption, reduced earnings per diluted share. Partially offsetting these impacts were benefits from restructuring actions taken in the second quarter of 2019.\n\n\u25cf\n\nDefined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense decreased expense year-on-year, which benefited earnings per diluted share.\n\n\u25cf\n\nLower income related to non-service cost components of pension and postretirement expense, increased expense year-on-year.\n\n\u25cf\n\nInterest expense (net of interest income) increased $88 million for 2019, as a result of higher U.S. average debt balances, partially offset by the increase in interest income driven by higher balances in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities during the year resulting from the proceeds from debt issuances in advance of the October 2019 Acelity acquisition.\n\n\u200b\n\n2019 restructuring actions: \n\n\u25cf\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2019, in light of slower than expected 2019 sales, and additionally in the fourth quarter to realign 3M\u2019s organizational structure and operating model to improve growth and operational efficiency, management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions. The Company recorded a fourth quarter 2019 pre-tax \n\n17\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \n\ncharge of $134 million and second quarter 2019 pre-tax charge of $148 million, which when combined, resulted in a full year 2019 impact of 41 cents per diluted share. See Note 5 for additional details. \n\n\u200b\n\nAcquisitions/divestitures:\n\n\u25cf\n\nAcquisition impacts, which are measured for the first twelve months post-transaction, relate to the acquisitions of M*Modal (first quarter 2019), and Acelity (fourth quarter 2019). These items collectively decreased earnings per diluted share by 19 cents year-on-year for 2019. The net impacts related to these acquisitions included income from operations, more than offset by transaction and integration costs. Interest expense related to financing costs of these acquisitions is also included. Expenses related to the October 2019 acquisition of Acelity also include financing costs and the tax effect of repatriating funds in advance of the close of the acquisition.\n\n\u25cf\n\nDivestiture impacts include the incremental year-on-year pre-tax gain on divestitures and the lost operating income from divested businesses (other than lost income related to the divestiture of the Communication Markets Division). These items collectively increased earnings per diluted share by 16 cents year-on-year for 2019. The net impacts included 14 cents for 2019 related to the gain from the third quarter 2019 divestiture of the Company\u2019s gas and flame detection business and 7 cents from the second quarter 2019 \u201cheld for sale\u201d tax benefit related to the legal entities associated with the divestiture. Other incremental year-on-year gains/losses on divestitures and the lost operating income from divested businesses decreased earnings per share by 5 cents for 2019.\n\n\u25cf\n\nIn addition to divestiture impacts above, remaining stranded costs and lost operating income related to the 2018 divestiture of the Communication Markets Division decreased earnings per diluted share by 4 cents year-on-year for 2019.\n\n\u200b\n\nForeign exchange impacts:\n\n\u25cf\n\nForeign currency impacts (net of hedging) were essentially flat year-on-year, excluding the impact of foreign currency changes on tax rates. \n\n\u200b\n\nIncome tax rate\n\n:\n\n\u25cf\n\nCertain items above reflect specific income tax rates associated therewith. Overall, the effective tax rate for 2019 was 19.8 percent, a decrease of 3.6 percentage points versus 2018. On an adjusted basis (as discussed below), the effective tax rate decreased 0.5 percentage points year-on-year for 2019.\n\n\u25cf\n\nFactors that decreased the effective tax rate on a GAAP basis for 2019 included prior year measurement period adjustments related to 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), prior year resolution of the NRD lawsuit (as described in Note 16) and geographical income mix. These decreases were partially offset by the deconsolidation of the Venezuelan subsidiary, adjustments to uncertain tax positions, and significant litigation-related charges. Refer to Note 10 for additional details.\n\n\u200b\n\nShares of common stock outstanding:\n\n\u25cf\n\nLower shares outstanding increased earnings per share year-on-year by 22 cents per diluted share for 2019. Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding in 2019 declined 2.8 percent year-on-year which benefited earnings per share. The decrease in the outstanding weighted-average diluted shares relates to the Company\u2019s purchase of $1.4 billion of its own stock in 2019.\n\n\u200b\n\nYear 2018 EPS:\n\n\u200b\n\n2017 divestiture of identity management business\n\n:\n\n\u25cf\n\nIn May 2017, \n\n3M completed the divestiture of its identity management business and reflected a pre-tax gain of $457 million, which was reported within the Company\u2019s Transportation and Electronics business.\n\n\u200b\n\nOrganic growth/productivity and other:\n\n\u25cf\n\n2018 year-on-year benefits include higher organic local-currency sales, selling price increases, and business transformation, which had a positive impact on 3M\u2019s productivity efforts. Higher raw material costs partially offset these year-on-year benefits.\n\n\u25cf\n\nLower year-on-year restructuring (other than activity related to the Communication Markets Division divestiture), portfolio and footprint actions increased pre-tax earnings by approximately $307 million in 2018. 2017 charges included $99 million in restructuring actions and $207 million in asset charges, accelerated depreciation and other costs.\n\n\u25cf\n\nInterest expense (net of interest income) increased $8 million year-on-year. While 2017 interest expense included a $96 million early debt extinguishment charge, 2018 net interest expense increased as a result of higher U.S. average debt balances and higher borrowing costs.\n\n18\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \n\n\u25cf\n\nOn a combined basis, higher defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense and defined contribution expense, in addition to lower income related to non-service cost components of pension and postretirement expense, increased expense year-on-year. \n\n\u200b\n\nAcquisitions/other divestiture gains:\n\n\u25cf\n\nIn aggregate, acquisitions, year-on-year divestitures gains (other than the sale of the Communication Markets Division and identity management business), and lost operating income from divested businesses (other than lost income related to the divestiture of the Communication Markets Division) decreased earnings per diluted share by 10 cents in 2018.\n\n\u25cf\n\nRemaining stranded costs and lost operating income related to the divestiture of the Communication Markets Division decreased earnings per diluted share by 5 cents year-on-year in 2018.\n\n\u200b\n\nForeign exchange impacts:\n\n\u25cf\n\nForeign currency impacts (net of hedging) decreased pre-tax earnings year-on-year by approximately $42 million, or the equivalent of 5 cents per diluted share, excluding the impact of foreign currency changes on tax rates. \n\n\u200b\n\nIncome tax rate:\n\n\u25cf\n\nCertain items above reflect specific income tax rates associated therewith. The effective tax rate for full year 2018 was 23.4 percent, a decrease of 12.1 percentage points versus 2017. On an adjusted basis (as described below), the effective income tax rate was 20.1 percent for 2018 versus 25.4 percent for 2017. \n\n\u25cf\n\nFactors that decreased the effective tax rate on a GAAP basis for 2018 primarily related to the favorable aspects of the TCJA such as the decrease in the U.S. income tax rate and foreign-derived intangible income (FDII), reduced transitional impact of TCJA related to transition tax and remeasurement of deferred tax assets/liabilities and increased benefits from the R&D tax credit. These decreases were partially offset by the elimination of the domestic manufacturing deduction, the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) provision, and lower excess tax benefits related to employee share-based payments. Refer to Note 10 for additional details.\n\n\u200b\n\nShares of common stock outstanding:\n\n\u25cf\n\nLower shares outstanding increased earnings per share by 18 cents per diluted share for full year 2018. Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding in 2018 declined 1.8 percent year-on-year, which benefited earnings per share. The decrease in the outstanding weighted-average diluted shares relates to the Company\u2019s purchase of $4.9 billion of its own stock in the 2018.\n\n\u200b\n\n2018 divestiture of Communication Markets Division, net of related restructuring actions and exit activities:\n\n\u25cf\n\nAs discussed above, in 2018, 3M completed the sale of substantially all of its Communication Markets Division and reflected a pre-tax gain of $509 million as a result of this divestiture. The divestiture was reported within the Company\u2019s Safety and Industrial business\n\n. Also as discussed above, during 2018, management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions related to addressing corporate functional costs following the Communication Markets Division divestiture that resulted in a pre-tax charge of $127 million, net of adjustments for reductions in cost estimates. The aggregate net impact of the gain on sale and related restructuring actions increased earnings per diluted share by 50 cents per diluted share for 2018. \n\n\u200b\n\nCertain amounts adjusted for impacts of significant litigation-related charges, deconsolidation of the Company\u2019s Venezuelan subsidiary, and enactment/measurement period adjustments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) -\u00a0(non-GAAP measures):\n\n\u200b\n\nIn 2019, the Company recorded significant litigation-related charges of $762 million ($590 million after tax) related to PFAS (certain perfluorinated compounds) matters and coal mine dust respirator mask lawsuits of which $214 million ($166 million after tax) occurred in the fourth quarter. The aggregate 2019 pre-tax charge was reflected in cost of sales ($328 million) and selling, general and administrative expense ($434 million). In 2018, 3M recorded significant litigation-related charges of $897 million ($770 million after tax) for PFAS matters related to the previously disclosed agreement reached with the State of Minnesota that resolved the Natural Resource Damages (NRD) lawsuit. Essentially all of the aggregate 2018 pre-tax charge was reflected in selling, general and administrative expense. These charges are further discussed in Note 16.\n\n\u200b\n\nIn the second quarter of 2019, 3M recorded a pre-tax charge of $162 million related to the deconsolidation of the Company\u2019s Venezuelan subsidiary as further discussed in Note 1.\n\n\u200b\n\n19\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \n\nWith respect to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), 3M recorded a $762 million tax expense in 2017 and additional net tax expense of $176 million in 2018 as a measurement period adjustment to the TCJA\u2019s enactment. See Note 10 for details.\n\n\u200b\n\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company also provides non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impacts of significant litigation-related charges, deconsolidation of the Company\u2019s Venezuelan subsidiary and measurement period adjustments to the enactment of the TCJA. These items represent significant amounts that impacted the Company\u2019s financial results. Operating income, income before taxes, net income, earnings per share, and effective tax rate are all measures for which 3M provides the reported GAAP measure and an adjusted measure. The adjusted measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP measures. The Company considers these non-GAAP measures in evaluating and managing the Company\u2019s operations. The Company believes that discussion of results adjusted for these items is meaningful to investors as it provides a useful analysis of ongoing underlying operating trends.

the preceding table is as follows:\n\n\u25cf\n\nIn the Asia Pacific geographic area, China/Hong Kong total sales increased 10 percent and organic local-currency sales increased 8 percent. In Japan, total sales and organic local currency sales decreased 2 percent. \n\n\u25cf\n\nIn the Latin America/Canada geographic area, total sales increased 1 percent in Mexico, as organic local-currency sales increases of 4 percent were partially offset by lost sales from divested businesses and foreign currency translation impacts. In Canada, total sales and organic local currency increased 5 percent. In Brazil, total sales decreased 8 percent, as organic local-currency sales growth of 5 percent was more than offset by foreign currency translation impacts.\n\n\u200b\n\nForeign currency translation increased year-on-year sales by 0.2 percent, with the translation-related sales increase in EMEA and Asia Pacific partially offset by the decreases in Latin America/Canada. Selling prices increased by 1.1 percent year-on-year for 2018, with strong price growth in Latin America/Canada, EMEA and the U.S. In Asia Pacific, price grew slightly, as strong volume growth in electronics had a negative impact on price.\n\n\u200b\n\nManaging currency risks:\n\nThe stronger U.S. dollar had a negative impact on sales in full year 2019 compared to the same period last year. Net of the Company\u2019s hedging strategy, foreign currency was neutral to earnings for full year 2019 compared to the same period last year. 3M utilizes a number of tools to hedge currency risk related to earnings. 3M uses natural hedges such as pricing, productivity, hard currency and hard currency-indexed billings, and localizing source of supply. 3M also uses financial hedges to mitigate currency risk. In the case of more liquid currencies, 3M hedges a portion of its aggregate exposure, using a 12, 24 or 36 month horizon, depending on the currency in question. For less liquid currencies, financial hedging is frequently more expensive with more limitations on tenor. Thus, this risk is \n\n23\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \n\nlargely managed via local operational actions using natural hedging tools as discussed above. In either case, 3M\u2019s hedging approach is designed to mitigate a portion of foreign currency risk and reduce volatility, ultimately allowing time for 3M\u2019s businesses to respond to changes in the marketplace.\n\n\u200b\n\nFinancial condition: \n\n\u200b\n\n3M generated $7.070 billion of operating cash flow in 2019, an increase of $631 million when compared to 2018. This increase was primarily due to significant litigation-related charges and the timing of associated payments that impacted 2019 and 2018. This followed an operating cash flow increase of $199 million when comparing 2018 to 2017. Refer to the section entitled \u201cFinancial Condition and Liquidity\u201d later in MD&A for a discussion of items impacting cash flows. \n\n\u200b\n\nIn November 2018, 3M\u2019s Board of Directors replaced the Company\u2019s February 2016 repurchase program with a new repurchase program. This new program authorizes the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M\u2019s outstanding common stock, with no pre-established end date. In 2019, the Company purchased $1.4 billion of its own stock, compared to purchases of $4.9 billion in 2018 and $2.1 billion in 2017. The Company expects to purchase approximately $1.0 billion of its own stock in 2020. In February 2020, 3M\u2019s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2020 dividend of $1.47 per share, an increase of 2 percent. This marked the 62\n\nnd\n\n consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M. \n\n\u200b\n\nRaw materials:\n\n\u200b\n\nIn 2019, the Company experienced raw material price inflation across many material markets in all geographies. In response, the Company continued to deploy productivity projects to minimize the impact of raw material inflation and market supply challenges, including input management, reformulations, and multi-sourcing activities. These succeeded in partially offsetting the overall raw material headwinds experienced throughout the year. To date, the Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is difficult to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories, strategic relationships with key suppliers, and development as well as qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps. In addition, 3M evaluates suppliers\u2019 conformance with environmental and social compliance requirements.\n\n\u200b\n\nPension and postretirement defined benefit/contribution plans:\n\n\u200b\n\nOn a worldwide basis, 3M\u2019s pension and postretirement plans were 87 percent funded at year-end 2019. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan, which is approximately 67 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 93 percent funded and the international pension plans were 87 percent funded. The U.S. non-qualified pension plan is not funded due to tax considerations and other factors. Asset returns in 2019 for the primary U.S. qualified pension plan were 16.3%, as 3M strategically invests in both growth assets and fixed income matching assets to manage its funded status. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2020 is 6.75%. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan year-end 2019 discount rate was 3.25%, down 1.11 percentage points from the year-end 2018 discount rate of 4.36%. The decrease in U.S. discount rates resulted in an increased valuation of the projected benefit obligation (PBO). The primary U.S. qualified pension plan\u2019s funded status decreased 3 percentage points in 2019 due to the higher PBO resulting from the significant discount rate decrease and partially offset by higher return on assets. Additional detail and discussion of international plan asset returns and discount rates is provided in Note 13 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans).\n\n\u200b\n\n3M expects to contribute approximately $100 million to $200 million of cash to its global defined benefit pension and postretirement plans in 2020. The Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2020. 3M expects global defined benefit pension and postretirement expense in 2020 (before settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) to increase by approximately $34 million pre-tax when compared to 2019. Refer to \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates\u201d within MD&A and Note 13 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans) for additional information concerning 3M\u2019s pension and post-retirement plans.\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n24\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \n\n2020 closed and recently announced divestitures:\n\n\u200b\n\nAs discussed in Note 3, in December 2019, 3M agreed to sell substantially all of its drug delivery business for approximately $650 million in consideration, subject to closing and other adjustments. 3M expects a pre-tax gain of approximately $400 million as a result of the divestiture that will be reported within the Company\u2019s Health Care business. The sale is expected to close in the first half of 2020.\n\n\u200b\n\nAlso as discussed in Note 3, in January 2020, 3M completed the sale of its advanced ballistic-protection business for $91 million, subject to closing and other adjustments, plus contingent consideration of up to $25 million depending on the outcome of pending tenders. The Company previously reflected an immaterial impact in 2019 as a result of measuring the disposal group at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.\n\n\u200b\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATI\n\nONS\n\n\u200b\n\nNet Sales:\n\n\u200b\n\nRefer to the preceding \u201cOverview\u201d section and the \u201cPerformance by Business Segment\u201d section later in MD&A for additional discussion of sales change.\n\n\u200b\n\nOperating Expenses:\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u200b\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u200b\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u200b\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u200b\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u200b\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n2019 versus \n\n\u200b\n\n2018 versus \n\n\u200b\n\n(Percent\u00a0of\u00a0net\u00a0sales)\n\n\u200b\n\n2019\n\n\u200b\n\n2018\n\n\u200b\n\n2017\n\n\u200b\n\n2018\n\n\u200b\n\n2017\n\n\u00a0\n\nCost of sales \n\n\u00a0\n\n 53.4\n\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\n 50.9\n\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\n 50.8\n\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\n 2.5\n\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\n 0.1\n\n%\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n\n\u00a0\n\n 21.9\n\n\u200b\n\n 23.2\n\n\u200b\n\n 20.9\n\n\u200b\n\n (1.3)\n\n\u200b\n\n 2.3\n\n\u200b\n\nResearch, development and related expenses\n\n\u00a0\n\n 5.9\n\n\u200b\n\n 5.6\n\n\u200b\n\n 5.9\n\n\u200b\n\n 0.3\n\n\u200b\n\n (0.3)\n\n\u200b\n\nGain on sale of businesses\n\n\u200b\n\n (0.4)\n\n\u200b\n\n (1.7)\n\n\u200b\n\n (1.9)\n\n\u200b\n\n 1.3\n\n\u200b\n\n 0.2\n\n\u200b\n\nOperating income margin\n\n\u00a0\n\n 19.2\n\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\n 22.0\n\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\n 24.3\n\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\n (2.8)\n\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\n (2.3)\n\n%\n\n\u200b\n\nOperating income margins decreased year over year for both 2019 and 2018. The decrease from 2018 to 2019 was primarily driven by softness in certain end markets and channel inventory adjustments, along with actions taken by 3M in response to lower sales volumes and high inventory levels, which resulted in lower manufacturing and inventory absorption. Additionally, higher year-on-year restructuring actions taken decreased operating income margins, partially offset by lower year-on-year significant litigation-related charges. The decrease from 2017 to 2018 was driven primarily by the charge related to the significant litigation-related charges (as discussed in the \n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\n section below). A number of factors impact the various income statement line items, such as raw material cost management, portfolio and footprint actions, divestitures, foreign currency, cost management, and pension and postretirement service cost effects. Expanded discussion of each of the income statement line items follows in the various sections below. Pension and postretirement service cost expense is recorded in cost of sales; selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A); and research, development and related expenses (R&D). In total, 3M\u2019s defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense decreased $58 million in 2019, compared to an increase of $21 million in 2018. Refer to Note 13 (Pension and Postretirement Plans) for the service cost components of net periodic benefit costs.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe Company is investing in an initiative called business transformation, with these investments impacting cost of sales, SG&A, and R&D. Business transformation encompasses the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis, as well as changes in processes and internal/external service delivery across 3M.\n\n\u200b\n\nCost of Sales:\n\n\u200b\n\nCost of sales includes manufacturing, engineering and freight costs. \n\n\u200b\n\nCost of sales, measured as a percent of sales, increased during full year 2019 when compared to full year 2018. Increases primarily related to lower sales volume year-on-year, which resulted in cost absorption penalties from lower sales volumes as all businesses worked to reduce inventories and improve cash flow and significant litigation-related charges taken in 2019 (as discussed earlier in the \n\nCertain amounts adjusted for impacts of significant litigation-related charges, deconsolidation of the Company\u2019s Venezuelan \n\n25\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \n\nsubsidiary, and enactment/measurement period adjustments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) -\u00a0(non-GAAP measures)\n\n. These factors were partially offset by selling price increases, which increased net sales year-on-year by 0.6 percent for full year 2019. \n\n\u200b\n\nCost of sales as a percent of sales, increased during 2018 primarily due to foreign currency effects (net of hedge losses). Additionally, cost of sales for full year 2018 were increased by the 2018 Communication Markets Division related restructuring charges as discussed in Note 5. This increase was partially offset by 2017 portfolio and supply chain footprint optimization charges that did not repeat in 2018 and selling price increases. Selling prices increased net sales year-on-year by 1.1 percent for full year 2018. These were partially offset by raw material cost increases and higher defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense and defined contribution expense. \n\n\u200b\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses:\n\n\u200b\n\nSG&A in dollars decreased 7.5 percent for full year 2019 when compared to full year 2018. The decrease primarily related to indirect cost reductions and lower year-on-year impact related to significant litigation-related charges (as discussed earlier in the \n\nCertain amounts adjusted for impacts of significant litigation-related charges, deconsolidation of the Company\u2019s Venezuelan subsidiary, and enactment/measurement period adjustments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) -\u00a0(non-GAAP measures)\n\n section). \n\n\u200b\n\nSG&A in dollars increased 14.7 percent for full year 2018 when compared to full year 2017. The increase is primarily associated with the Communication Markets Division-related restructuring charges (as discussed in Note 5) and the charge related to the Minnesota NRD resolution (as discussed earlier in the \n\nCertain amounts adjusted for impacts of significant litigation-related charges, deconsolidation of the Company\u2019s Venezuelan subsidiary, and enactment/measurement period adjustments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) -\u00a0(non-GAAP measures) \n\nsection and further in Note 16). This increase was partially offset by 2017 portfolio and supply chain footprint optimization charges that did not repeat in 2018.\n\n\u200b\n\nResearch, Development and Related Expenses:\n\n \n\n\u200b\n\nR&D in dollars increased $90 million for the full year 2019 when compared to full year 2018. R&D, measured as a percent of sales was 5.9% in 2019, compared to 5.6% in 2018 and 5.9% in 2017. The increase from 2018 was driven by 3M continued investment in its key initiatives, including R&D aimed at disruptive innovation programs with the potential to create entirely new markets and disrupt existing markets. In addition, R&D increased due to additional spending related to the Company\u2019s acquisitions in 2019.\n\n\u200b\n\nR&D in dollars decreased $49 million for full year 2018 when compared to full year 2017. The decrease primarily relates to R&D no longer incurred related to the Communication Markets Division, which was divested in 2018. \n\n\u200b\n\nGain on Sale of Businesses:\n\n\u200b\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, the Company sold certain oral care technology comprising a business and reflected an earnout on a previous divestiture resulting in an aggregate immaterial gain. During 2019, the Company sold its gas and flame detection business for a pre-tax gain of $112 million. 3M also divested certain businesses in 2018 and 2017, resulting in gains of $547 million and $586 million, respectively.

Of the total $282 million charge reflected in 2019, $148 million was recorded in the second quarter, of which $35 million was associated with a voluntary retirement incentive program that impacted second quarter other expense (income), and an additional $134 million recorded in the fourth quarter. \n\n\u200b\n\nAcquisitions/divestitures: \n\n\u25cf\n\nAcquisition-related impacts relate to the on-going integration of M*Modal and Acelity, which decreased operating income margins year-on-year. \n\n\u25cf\n\nDivestiture impacts (which is comprised of higher year-on-year divestiture gains other than the Communication Markets Division in addition to lost operating income from divested businesses) increased operating income margins year-on-year and primary related to the gain from the divestiture of the Company\u2019s gas and flame detection business.\n\n\u25cf\n\nRemaining stranded costs to be addressed from the 2018 divestiture of the Communication Markets Division also reduced operating margins year-on-year.\n\n\u200b\n\nSelling price and raw material impact: \n\n\u25cf\n\nHigher selling prices, partially offset by raw material cost increases, benefited operating income margins year-on-year for 2019.\n\n\u200b\n\nForeign exchange impacts: \n\n\u25cf\n\nForeign currency effects (net of hedge gains) increased operating income margins year-on-year. \n\n\u200b\n\nSignificant litigation-related charges\n\n: \n\n\u25cf\n\nOperating income margins for 2018 and 2019 included the $897 million and $762 million impact, respectively, of significant litigation-related charges (as discussed earlier in the \n\nCertain amounts adjusted for impacts of significant litigation-related charges, deconsolidation of the Company\u2019s Venezuelan subsidiary, and enactment/measurement period adjustments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) -\u00a0(non-GAAP measures)\n\n section.\n\n\u200b\n\nYear 2018 operating income:\n\n\u200b\n\nOperating income margins decreased 2.3 percentage points for the full year 2018 when compared to full year 2017.\n\n\u200b\n\n2017 divestiture of identity management business:\n\n\u25cf\n\nOperating income margins decreased year-on-year due to the gain on the May 2017 divestiture of the Company\u2019s former identity management business.\n\n\u200b\n\nOrganic volume/productivity and other:\n\n\u25cf\n\nOperating income margins increased year-on-year due to benefits from organic local-currency growth and productivity, in addition to lower year-on-year portfolio and supply chain footprint optimization charges.\n\n\u25cf\n\nOperating income margins decreased year-on-year due to higher defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense and defined contribution expense.\n\n\u200b\n\nAcquisitions/other divestiture gains:\n\n\u25cf\n\nAcquisition impacts (primarily related to Scott Safety), in addition to lower year-on-year divestiture gains (excluding the identity management business and Communication Markets Division), decreased operating margins year-on-year.\n\n\u25cf\n\nRemaining stranded costs to be addressed from the divestiture of the Communication Markets Division reduced operating margins year-on-year.\n\n\u25cf\n\nOperating income margins increased year-on-year due to the lost lower-margin operating income from divested businesses.\n\n\u200b\n\nSelling price and raw material impact:\n\n\u25cf\n\nHigher selling prices, partially offset by raw material cost increases, benefited operating income margins year-on-year.\n\n\u200b\n\n28\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \n\nForeign exchange impacts:\n\n\u25cf\n\nForeign currency effects (net of hedge gains) decreased operating income margins year-on-year for the full year 2018.\n\n\u200b\n\n2018 divestiture of Communication Markets Division, net of related restructuring actions:\n\n\u25cf\n\nAs discussed above, in 2018, 3M completed the sale of substantially all of its Communication Markets Division and reflected a pre-tax gain of $509 million as a result of this divestiture.

The increase in 2019 was driven by higher U.S. average debt balances, partially offset by the year-on-year increase in interest income driven by higher balances in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities during the year resulting from the proceeds from debt issuances in advance of the October 2019 Acelity acquisition. While 2017 interest expense included a $96 million early debt extinguishment charge, 2018 net interest expense increased as a result of higher U.S. average debt balances and higher borrowing costs.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe increase in other expense (income) during 2019 was primarily due to the impact of deconsolidation of the Company\u2019s Venezuelan subsidiary. Refer to Note 1 for additional details. \n\n\u200b\n\nIn addition, other expense (income) was impacted by lower year-on-year pension and postretirement net periodic benefit non-service benefits of $5 million and $55 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively. The lower year-on-year benefit in 2019 was primarily due to the second quarter 2019 charge associated with the voluntary retirement incentive program in addition to pension settlement charges in the fourth quarter 2019 related to employee retirements. The decrease in 2018 was primarily due to an increase in net actuarial amortization expense.

The effective tax rate for 2018 was 23.4 percent, compared to 35.5 percent in 2017, a decrease of 12.1 percentage points. The changes in the tax rates between years were impacted by many factors, including measurement period adjustments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), prior year resolution of the NRD lawsuit, and geographical income mix offset by the impact from the deconsolidation of the Company\u2019s Venezuelan subsidiary as further described in the Overview, \n\nCertain amounts adjusted for impacts of significant litigation-related charges, deconsolidation of the Company\u2019s Venezuelan subsidiary, and enactment/measurement period adjustments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) -\u00a0(non-GAAP measures) \n\nsection and in Note 10.

Disclosures relating to 3M\u2019s business segments are provided in Note 19. Effective in the second quarter of 2019, to enable the Company to better serve global customers and markets, the Company made the following changes to its business segments:\n\n\u200b\n\nRealignment of the Company\u2019s business segments from five to four\n\n \n\n\u00a0 \n\nThe Company realigned its former five business segments into four: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer. Existing divisions were largely realigned to this new structure. In addition, certain retail auto care product lines formerly in the Automotive Aftermarket Division (now within the Safety and Industrial business segment) were moved to the Construction and Home Improvement Division (within the Consumer business segment). Also, product lines relating to the refrigeration filtration business, formerly included in the Separation and Purification Sciences Division (now within the Health Care business segment) were moved to Other Safety and Industrial (within the Safety and Industrial business segment). 3M business segment reporting measures include dual credit to business segments for certain sales and operating income. Dual credit, which is based on which business segment provides customer account activity with respect to a particular product sold in a specific country, was reduced as a result of the closer alignment between customer account activity and their respective markets. The four business segments are as follows:\n\nSafety and Industrial\n\n: This segment includes businesses that serve the global industrial, electrical and safety markets. This business segment consists of personal safety, industrial adhesives and tapes, abrasives, closure and masking systems, electrical markets, automotive aftermarket, and roofing granules. This segment also includes the Communication Markets Division (which was substantially sold in 2018) and the refrigeration filtration product lines (within Other Safety and Industrial).\n\nTransportation and Electronics:\n\n This segment includes businesses that serve global transportation and electronic original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers. This business segment consists of electronics (display materials and systems, electronic materials solutions), automotive and aerospace, commercial solutions, advanced materials, and transportation safety.\n\nHealth Care\n\n: This business segment serves the global healthcare industry and includes medical solutions, oral care, separation and purification sciences, health information systems, drug delivery systems, and food safety.\n\nConsumer\n\n: This business serves global consumers and consists of home improvement, stationery and office supplies, home care, and consumer health care. This segment also includes, within the Construction and Home Improvement Division, certain retail auto care product lines. \n\n30\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \n\n\u200b\n\nIn addition, as part of 3M\u2019s continuing effort to improve the alignment of its businesses around markets and customers, the Company made the following changes, effective in the first quarter of 2019, and other revisions impacting business segment reporting:\n\n\u200b\n\nContinued alignment of customer account activity\n\n\u25cf\n\nAs part of 3M\u2019s regular customer-focus initiatives, the Company realigned certain customer account activity (\u201csales district\u201d) to correlate with the primary divisional product offerings in various countries and reduce complexity for customers when interacting with multiple 3M businesses. This largely impacted the amount of dual credit certain business segments receive as a result of sales district attribution. 3M business segment reporting measures include dual credit to business segments for certain sales and operating income. This dual credit is based on which business segment provides customer account activity with respect to a particular product sold in a specific country.\n\n\u200b\n\nCreation of Closure and Masking Systems Division and Medical Solutions Division\n\n\u25cf\n\n3M created the Closure and Masking Systems Division, which combines the masking tape, packaging tape and personal care portfolios formerly within Industrial Adhesives and Tapes Division in the former Industrial business segment into a separate division also within the former Industrial business segment. 3M created the Medical Solutions Division in the Health Care business segment, which combines the former Critical and Chronic Care Division and Infection Prevention Division (which were also both within the Health Care business segment).\n\n\u200b\n\nAdditional actions impacting business segment reporting\n\n\u25cf\n\nThe business associated with certain safety products sold through retail channels in the Asia Pacific region was realigned from the Personal Safety Division within the former Safety and Graphics business segment to the Construction and Home Improvement Division within the Consumer business segment. In addition, certain previously non-allocated costs related to manufacturing and technology of centrally managed material resource centers of expertise within Corporate and Unallocated are now reflected as being allocated to the business segments.\n\n\u200b\n\nBusiness segment information presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. 3M manages its operations in four business segments. The reportable segments are Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer.\n\n\u200b\n\nCorporate and Unallocated:\n\n\u200b\n\nIn addition to these four business segments, 3M assigns certain costs to \u201cCorporate and Unallocated,\u201d which is presented separately in the preceding business segments table and in Note 19. Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, such as corporate investment gains and losses, certain derivative gains and losses, certain insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and environmental expenses, corporate restructuring charges and certain under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension) that the Company determines not to allocate directly to its business segments. Corporate and Unallocated also includes sales, costs, and income from contract manufacturing, transition services and other arrangements with the acquirer of the Communication Markets Division following its divestiture in 2018. Because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.\n\n\u200b\n\nCorporate and Unallocated operating expenses decreased by $166 million in 2019 when compared to 2018. In 2018 and 2019, significant litigation-related charges of $897 million and $762 million, respectively, were reflected in Corporate and Unallocated. In 2018 and 2019, operating expenses included $127 million (net of adjustments for reductions in cost estimates) and $140 million, respectively, of the restructuring actions further discussed in Note 5. In the third quarter, operating expenses were partially offset by a gain related to sales of certain properties. In addition, 3M\u2019s defined benefit pension and postretirement service-cost expense allocation to Corporate and Unallocated decreased year-on-year.\n\n\u200b\n\nCorporate and Unallocated operating expenses increased by $1 billion in 2018 when compared to 2017. Beginning in the second quarter of 2018, the operating income from contractual manufacturing and other arrangements described in the paragraph above were included in Corporate and Unallocated. In addition, in 2018, operating expenses included the restructuring charge of $127 million, net of adjustments for reductions in cost estimates, as discussed in Note 5 related to addressing corporate functional costs following the Communication Markets Division divestiture. In the first quarter of 2018, the Minnesota NRD resolution ($897 million), inclusive of \n\n31\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \n\nlegal fees and other related obligations, was reflected in Corporate and Unallocated. In addition, 3M\u2019s defined benefit pension and postretirement service-cost expense allocation to Corporate and Unallocated increased year-on-year. \n\n\u200b\n\nOperating Business Segments:\n\n\u200b\n\nInformation related to 3M\u2019s business segments is presented in the tables that follow. Organic local-currency sales include both organic volume impacts plus selling price impacts. Acquisition and divestiture impacts, if any, are measured separately for the first twelve months post-transaction.

Export sales are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3M customers are made. A portion of the products or components sold by 3M\u2019s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas. As customers move their operations from one geographic area to another, 3M\u2019s results will follow. Thus, net sales in a particular geographic area are not indicative of end-user consumption in that geographic area.

Capital spending is discussed in more detail later in MD&A in the section entitled \u201cCash Flows from Investing Activities.\u201d\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMA\n\nTES\n\n\u200b\n\nInformation regarding significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements. As stated in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe Company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings, pension and postretirement obligations, goodwill and certain long-lived assets, and uncertainty in income tax positions. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of 3M\u2019s Board of Directors.\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n37\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \n\nLegal Proceedings:\n\n\u200b\n\nAssessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. \n\nThe Company accrues an estimated liability for legal proceeding claims that are both probable and estimable in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 450, \n\nContingencies\n\n. Please refer to the section entitled \u201cProcess for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities Related to Legal Proceedings\u201d (contained in \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Note 16) for additional information about such estimates.\n\n\u200b\n\nPension and Postretirement Obligations:\n\n\u200b\n\nThe Company makes certain estimates and judgements in relation to its defined benefit pension and postretirement obligations. \n\n\u200b\n\nThe benefit obligation represents the present value of the benefits that employees are entitled to in the future for services already rendered as of the measurement date. The Company measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting benefit payment cash flows for each future period and discounting these cash flows back to the December 31 measurement date, using the yields of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Service cost and interest cost are measured separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. Service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income.\n\n\u200b\n\nUsing this methodology, the Company determined discount rates for its plans as follow:\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nU.S. Qualified Pension\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nInternational Pension (weighted average)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nU.S. Postretirement Medical\n\n\u200b\n\nDecember 31, 2019 Liability:\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nBenefit obligation\n\n\u200b\n\n 3.25\n\n%\n\n 1.81\n\n%\n\n 3.13\n\n%\n\n2020 Net Periodic Benefit Cost Components:\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nService cost\n\n\u200b\n\n 3.44\n\n%\n\n 1.61\n\n%\n\n 3.35\n\n%\n\nInterest cost\n\n\u200b\n\n 2.88\n\n%\n\n 1.61\n\n%\n\n 2.73\n\n%\n\n\u200b\n\nAnother significant element in determining the Company\u2019s pension expense is the expected return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets for the primary U.S. qualified pension plan is based on strategic asset allocation of the plan, long-term capital market return expectations, and expected performance from active investment management. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2020 is 6.75%, a decrease from 7.00% in 2019. Return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions. The weighted average expected return for the international pension plan is 4.70% for 2020, compared to 4.90% for 2019. Refer to Note 13 for information on how the 2019 rates were determined.\n\n\u200b\n\n3M follows ASC 820, \n\nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures\n\n in determining the fair value of plan assets within the Company\u2019s pension and postretirement benefit plans. While the Company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. See Note\u00a013 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining defined benefit pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.\n\n\u200b\n\nFor the year ended December\u00a031, 2019, the Company recognized consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement service cost expense of $425 million and a benefit of $68 million related to all non-service pension and postretirement net benefit costs (after settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) for a total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of $357 million, down from $410\u00a0million in 2018. \n\n\u200b\n\nIn 2020, defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense is anticipated to total approximately $458 million while non-service pension and postretirement net benefit costs (before settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) is \n\n38\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \n\nanticipated to be a benefit of approximately $67 million, for a total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of $391 million, an increase of approximately $34 million compared to 2019.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe table below summarizes the impact on 2020 pension expense for the U.S. and international pension plans of a 0.25 percentage point increase/decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions used to measure plan liabilities and 2019 net periodic benefit cost.

Those include considerations made in the valuation of certain acquired identifiable definite-lived and indefinite-lived assets as a result of business combinations as well as considerations in the recoverability and impairment assessments of long-lived assets and goodwill.\n\n\u200b\n\nAcquisition of certain identifiable definite-lived and indefinite-lived assets\n\n\u200b\n\nIn conjunction with an acquisition of a business, the Company records identifiable definite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired at their respective fair values as of the date of acquisition. The corresponding fair value estimates for these assets acquired include projected future cash flows, associated discount rates used to calculate present value, asset life cycles, royalty rates, and customer retention rates. The fair value calculated for indefinite-lived intangible assets such as certain tradenames, in addition to intangible assets that are definite-lived such as patents, customer relationships, tradenames and other technology-based assets may change during the finalization of the purchase price allocation, due to the significant estimates used in determining their fair value. As a result, the Company may make adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded for certain items as part of the purchase price allocation subsequent to the acquisition, not to exceed one year after the acquisition date, until the purchase accounting allocation is finalized.\n\n\u200b\n\nAssessments of long-lived assets and goodwill\n\n\u200b\n\nAs of December\u00a031, 2019, net property, plant and equipment totaled $9.3 billion and net identifiable intangible assets totaled $6.4 billion, of which $0.6 billion related to indefinite-lived tradenames. In addition, 3M goodwill totaled approximately $13.4 billion as of December\u00a031, 2019. \n\nLong-lived assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows from the asset\u2019s or asset group\u2019s ongoing use and eventual disposition. If an impairment is identified, the amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset\u2019s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. Intangible assets with an indefinite life, namely certain tradenames, are not amortized. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and are tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. An impairment loss would be recognized when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, as further discussed below, and is tested between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired.\n\n If future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3M would expect that only a portion of the long-lived assets or goodwill would be impaired. \n\nManagement makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time. This includes the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses. These estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. For instance, expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group. Factors which could result in future impairment charges include, among others, changes in worldwide economic conditions, changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These risk factors are discussed in Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d of this document. In addition, changes in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing results.\n\n39\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \n\n\u200b\n\nAs of December\u00a031, 2019, the $0.6 billion of indefinite-lived tradenames primarily relates to Capital Safety (acquired in 2015), whose tradenames ($520 million at acquisition date) have been in existence for over 55 years (refer to Note 4 for more detail). The primary valuation technique used in estimating the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets (tradenames) is a discounted cash flow approach. Specifically, a relief of royalty rate is applied to estimated sales, with the resulting amounts then discounted using an appropriate market/technology discount rate. The relief of royalty rate is the estimated royalty rate a market participant would pay to acquire the right to market/produce the product. Based on impairment testing in the third quarter of 2019, no impairment was indicated. The discounted cash flows related to the Capital Safety tradenames exceeded its book value by more than 20 percent in aggregate.\n\n\u200b\n\n3M goodwill totaled approximately $13.4 billion as of December\u00a031, 2019. 3M\u2019s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of each year. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but are required to be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. At 3M, reporting units correspond to a division. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit\u2019s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, and the loss would equal that difference. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3M typically uses the price/earnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows. 3M uses the discounted cash flow approach for start-up, loss position and declining businesses, in addition to using for businesses where the price/earnings ratio valuation method indicates additional review is warranted. 3M also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions. Where applicable, 3M used a weighted-average discounted cash flow analysis for certain divisions, using projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions, among other factors. The weighting was based on management\u2019s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring.\n\n\u200b\n\nAs described in Note 19, effective in the second quarter of 2019, the Company realigned its former five business segments into four to enable the Company to better serve global customers and markets. In addition, effective in the first quarter of 2019, 3M made business segment reporting changes to align its businesses around markets and customers. For any product moves that resulted in reporting unit changes, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units. During both the first and second quarters of 2019, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed. The discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2019 annual impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time.\n\n\u200b\n\nBased on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2019, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units.\n\n \n\nAs of October\u00a01, 2019, 3M had 23 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 91 percent of the goodwill. These ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: Advanced Materials, Display Materials and Systems, Electronics Materials Solutions, Health Information Systems,\u00a0Industrial Adhesives and Tapes,\u00a0Medical Solutions, Oral Care Solutions, Personal Safety, Separation and Purification Sciences, and Transportation Safety.\n\n\u200b\n\n3M is a highly integrated enterprise, where businesses share technology and leverage common fundamental strengths and capabilities, thus many of 3M\u2019s businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3M\u2019s focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3M\u2019s value being comprised of internally developed businesses that have no goodwill associated with them. \n\n\u200b\n\n3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2020 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment.\n\n\u200b\n\nUncertainty in Income Tax Positions:\n\n\u200b\n\nThe extent of 3M\u2019s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The Company follows guidance provided by ASC 740,\u00a0\n\nIncome Taxes\n\n, a subset of which relates to uncertainty in income taxes, to record these liabilities (refer to Note 10 for additional \n\n40\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \n\ninformation). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company\u2019s current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the Company\u2019s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary.\n\n\u200b\n\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEM\n\nENTS\n\n\u200b\n\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n\u200b\n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDI\n\nTY\n\n\u200b\n\nThe strength and stability of 3M\u2019s business model and strong free cash flow capability, together with proven capital markets access, positions the Company to be able to add further leverage to its capital structure. Investing in 3M\u2019s businesses to drive organic growth remains the first priority for capital deployment, including research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. Investment in organic growth will be supplemented by complementary acquisitions. 3M will also continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Sources for cash availability in the United States, such as ongoing cash flow from operations and access to capital markets, have historically been sufficient to fund dividend payments to shareholders, as well as funding U.S. acquisitions and other items as needed. The TCJA creates additional repatriation opportunities for 3M to access international cash positions on a continual and on-going basis and will help support U.S. capital deployments needs.\n\n \n\nFor those international earnings still considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. See Note 10 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely. \n\n\u200b\n\n3M\u2019s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3M\u2019s commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. At December\u00a031, 2019, there was approximately $150 million in commercial paper issued and outstanding.\n\n\u200b\n\nTotal Debt:\n\n\u200b\n\nThe strength of 3M\u2019s capital structure and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company\u2019s maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. 3M currently has an A1 credit rating with a stable outlook from Moody\u2019s Investors Service and has an AA- credit rating with Standard & Poor\u2019s; Standard & Poor\u2019s placed 3M on \u201cCreditWatch Negative\u201d in January 2020. \n\n\u200b\n\nThe Company\u2019s total debt was $5.7 billion higher at December\u00a031, 2019 when compared to December\u00a031, 2018. Increases in debt related to the first quarter and third quarter 2019 issuances of $2.25 billion of medium-term notes and $3.25 billion of other registered notes, respectively, in addition to the 69 billion Japanese Yen (approximately $632 million at December 31, 2019 exchange rates) outstanding from the 80 billion Japanese Yen credit facility established in September 2019 and the 150 million Euro (approximately $168 million at December 31, 2019 exchange rates) outstanding credit facility established in November 2019. Total debt also increased as a result of debt assumed from the October 2019 Acelity Inc. acquisition that was not settled at close as discussed below. These increases were partially offset by the June 2019 repayment of $625 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium-term notes that matured in addition to lower commercial paper outstanding. For discussion of repayments of and proceeds from debt refer to the following \u201cCash Flows from Financing Activities\u201d section.\n\n\u200b\n\nIn conjunction with the October 2019 acquisition of Acelity Inc. of the debt assumed, 3M did not immediately settle at close $0.5 billion of notes and, instead, satisfied and discharged those notes via an in-substance defeasance. Refer to Note 12 for additional information.\n\n\u200b\n\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it would no longer require banks to submit rates for the London InterBank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) after 2021. The Company is in the process of reviewing its debt securities, bank facilities, derivative instruments and commercial contracts that utilize LIBOR as the reference rate. 3M will continue its impact assessment and monitor regulatory developments during the transition period. \n\n41\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \n\n\u200b\n\nEffective February\u00a024, 2017, the Company updated its \u201cwell-known seasoned issuer\u201d (WKSI) shelf registration statement, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future issuance and sale. This replaced 3M\u2019s previous shelf registration dated May\u00a016, 2014. In May 2016, in connection with the WKSI shelf, 3M entered into an amended and restated distribution agreement relating to the future issuance and sale (from time to time) of the Company\u2019s medium-term notes program (Series F), up to the aggregate principal amount of $18 billion, which was an increase from the previous aggregate principal amount up to $9 billion of the same Series. \n\n\u200b\n\nAs of December\u00a031, 2019, the total amount of debt issued as part of the medium-term notes program (Series F), inclusive of debt issued in February 2019 and prior years is approximately $17.6 billion (utilizing the foreign exchange rates applicable at the time of issuance for the Euro denominated debt). Additionally, the August 2019 debt was issued under the WKSI shelf registration, but not as part of the medium-term notes program (Series F). Information with respect to long-term debt issuances and maturities for the periods presented is included in Note 12.\n\n\u200b\n\nIn November 2019, 3M amended and restated its existing $3.75 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in March 2021 to a $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in November 2024. The revolving credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to $1.0 billion (at lender\u2019s discretion), bringing the total facility up to $4.0 billion. In addition, 3M entered into a $1.25 billion 364-day credit facility expiring in November 2020. The 364-day credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may convert any advances outstanding on the maturity date into term loans with a maturity date one year later. These credit facilities were undrawn at December\u00a031, 2019. Under both the $3.0 billion and $1.25 billion credit agreements, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At December\u00a031, 2019, this ratio was approximately 17 to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends.\n\n\u200b\n\nApart from the committed credit facilities described above, in September 2019, 3M entered into a credit facility expiring in July 2020 in the amount of 80 billion Japanese Yen. At December\u00a031, 2019, 69 billion Japanese Yen, or approximately $632 million at December\u00a031, 2019 exchange rates, was drawn and outstanding. In November 2019, 3M entered into a credit facility expiring in November 2020 in the amount of 150 million Euros. At December 31, 2019, 150 million Euros, or $168 million at December 31, 2019 exchange rates, was drawn and outstanding. The Company also had an additional $268 million in stand-alone letters of credit and bank guarantees were also issued and outstanding at December\u00a031, 2019. These instruments are utilized in connection with normal business activities.\n\n\u200b\n\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities:\n\n\u200b\n\nAt December\u00a031, 2019, 3M had $2.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $2.4 billion was held by the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries and approximately $100 million was held by the United States. These balances are invested in bank instruments and other high-quality fixed income securities. At December\u00a031, 2018, 3M had $3.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $3.1 billion was held by the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries and approximately $160 million was held by the United States. Specifics concerning marketable securities investments are provided in Note 11.\n\n\u200b\n\nNet Debt (non-GAAP measure):\n\n\u200b\n\nNet debt is not defined under U.S. GAAP and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Working capital is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines working capital as current assets minus current liabilities. 3M believes working capital is meaningful to investors as a measure of operational efficiency and short-term financial health. \n\n\u200b\n\nWorking capital decreased $2,716 million compared with December\u00a031, 2018. Current asset balance changes decreased working capital by $738 million, driven by reductions in cash and cash equivalents. Working capital decreases also relate to decreases in accounts receivable and in inventories (discussed further below). Current liability balance changes decreased working capital by $1,978 million, primarily due to increases the current portion of long-term debt due to upcoming maturities in 2020, accruals related to respirator mask/asbestos and other environmental liabilities, net of related subsequent payments (refer to Note 16 for additional details on these accruals), in addition to the current portion of operating lease liabilities due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, \n\nLeases \n\n(refer to Note 17 for additional details on leases).\n\n\u200b\n\nAccounts receivable decreased $229 million from December\u00a031, 2018, primarily due to lower year-on-year sales in addition to continued focus on improving cash flows, partially offset by the receivables acquired from the M*Modal and Acelity Inc. acquisitions. Inventory decreased $232 million from December\u00a031, 2018 as a result of the Company\u2019s commitment to improve its response to slowing growth conditions in several key end markets and channel inventory adjustments by customers partially offset by inventory from the Acelity Inc. acquisition.\n\n\u200b\n\n43\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \n\n\u200b\n\nReturn on Invested Capital (non-GAAP measure):\n\n\u200b\n\nReturn on Invested Capital (ROIC) is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Therefore, ROIC should not be considered a substitute for other measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines ROIC as adjusted net income (net income including non-controlling interest plus after-tax interest expense) divided by average invested capital (equity plus debt). The Company believes ROIC is meaningful to investors as it focuses on shareholder value creation. The calculation is provided in the below table.\n\n\u200b\n\nIn 2019, ROIC of 17.5 percent was lower than 2018. The decrease in 2019 when compared to 2018 was driven by lower net income from the 2019 impact of significant litigation-related charges in addition to the charge from the deconsolidation of the Company\u2019s Venezuela subsidiary. ROIC was also negatively impacted by the increase in cash and cash equivalents in anticipation of the funding of the acquisition of Acelity. \n\n\u200b\n\nIn 2018, ROIC of 22.2 percent was higher than 2017. The increase in 2018 when compared to 2017 was negatively impacted by the measurement period adjustments taken in 2018 to the expense recorded in December 2017 from the enactment of the TCJA, the impact from the resolution of the Minnesota natural resource damages (NRD) resolution, and the impact from the gain on sale of the Communication Markets Division, net of restructuring actions related to addressing corporate functional costs following the divestiture, which combined reduced ROIC by 2 percentage points in 2018.\n\n\u200b\n\n

Additional factors that increased operating cash flows were decreases in inventory and accounts receivable. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by $598 million in 2019, compared to the working capital decreases of $406 million in 2018. Additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the \u201cFinancial Condition and Liquidity\u201d section.\n\n\u200b\n\nIn 2018, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $199 million compared to the same period last year, with the increase primarily made up of higher net income and lower year-on-year pension and postretirement contributions. The increase was partially offset primarily due to the significant litigation-related charges from the previously disclosed resolution of the Minnesota natural resource damages (NRD) in the first quarter of 2018 and year-on-year increases in income tax payments. Additional factors that decreased operating cash flows were increases in inventory and accounts receivable. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by $406 million in 2018, compared to the working capital increases of $608 million in 2017.

Costs related to maintenance, ordinary repairs, and certain other items are expensed. 3M also invests in growth, which adds to capacity, driven by new products, both through expansion of current facilities and new facilities. Finally, 3M also invests in other initiatives, such as information technology (IT), laboratory facilities, and a continued focus on investments in sustainability.\n\n\u200b\n\nRefer to Note 3 for information on acquisitions and divestitures. The Company is actively considering additional acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances, and from time to time may also divest certain businesses. Acquisitions, net of cash acquired, in 2019 primarily includes the purchase of M*Modal and Acelity Inc. Proceeds from sale of businesses in 2019 primarily relate to the sale of 3M\u2019s gas and flame detection business and the sale of certain oral care technology comprising a business.\n\n\u200b\n\nPurchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments are primarily attributable to asset-backed securities, certificates of deposit/time deposits, commercial paper, and other securities, which are classified as available-for-sale.

Outstanding commercial paper was $150 million at December\u00a031, 2019, as compared to $435 million at December\u00a031, 2018.

Increases in debt related to the third quarter 2018 issuance of $2.25 billion of medium-term notes, which was partially offset by the $450 million third quarter repayment and 500 million Euro fourth quarter repayment of maturing medium-term notes, the net impact of repayments and borrowings of international subsidiaries along with foreign currency effects, and lower year on year commercial paper balance.\u00a0Outstanding commercial paper decreased $310 million from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018.

Refer to Note 12 for more detail regarding debt issuances.\n\n\u200b\n\nRepurchases of Common Stock:\n\n\u200b\n\nRepurchases of common stock are made to support the Company\u2019s stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. In November\u00a02018, 3M\u2019s Board of Directors replaced the Company\u2019s February 2016 repurchase program with a new repurchase program. This new program authorizes the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M\u2019s outstanding common stock, with no pre-established end date. In 2019, the Company purchased $1.4 billion of its own stock, compared to purchases of $4.9 billion and $2.1 billion in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company expects full-year 2020 gross share repurchases to be approximately $1.0 billion. For more information, refer to the table titled \u201cIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\u201d in Part\u00a0II,\u00a0Item 5. The Company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the Company\u2019s stock.\n\n\u200b\n\nDividends Paid to Shareholders:\n\n\u200b\n\nCash dividends paid to shareholders totaled $3.316 billion ($5.76 per share) in 2019, $3.193 billion ($5.44 per share) in 2018, and $2.803 billion $4.70 per share) in 2017. 3M has paid dividends since 1916. In February\u00a02020, 3M\u2019s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2020 dividend of $1.47 per share, an increase of 2 percent. This is equivalent to an annual dividend of $5.88 per share and marked the 62\n\nnd\n\n consecutive year of dividend increases.\n\n\u200b\n\nOther cash flows from financing activities may include various other items, such as cash paid associated with certain derivative instruments, distributions to or sales of noncontrolling interests, changes in cash overdraft balances, and principal payments for finance leases.\n\n\u200b\n\nFree Cash Flow (non-GAAP measure):\n\n\u200b\n\nFree cash flow and free cash flow conversion are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, they should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The Company defines free cash flow conversion as free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3M. The Company believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are meaningful to investors as they are useful measures of performance and the Company uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to \n\n47\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \n\ngenerate cash. The first quarter of each year is typically 3M\u2019s seasonal low for free cash flow and free cash flow conversion. Below find a recap of free cash flow and free cash flow conversion for 2019, 2018 and 2017.\n\n\u200b\n\nIn 2019, free cash flow conversion was impacted by the $762 million pre-tax charge related to the significant litigation-related charges, the $162 million pre-tax impact from the deconsolidation of the Company\u2019s Venezuelan subsidiary, and the $112 million pre-tax divestiture gain from the gas and flame detection business. \n\n\u200b\n\nIn 2018, free cash flow conversion was impacted by the $176 million measurement period adjustment to the tax expense recorded in December 2017 from the enactment of the TCJA, the $897 million pre-tax charge related to the significant litigation-related charges from the previously disclosed resolution of the Minnesota natural resource damages (NRD), and the $381 million pre-tax gain on sale of the Communication Markets Division, net of restructuring actions related to addressing corporate functional costs following the divestiture.\n\n\u200b\n\nRefer to the preceding \u201cCash Flows from Operating Activities\u201d section for discussion of additional items that impacted operating cash flow.

See Note 10 for additional details.\n\n\u200b\n\nUnconditional purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company. Included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts, capital commitments, service agreements and utilities. These estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year. Many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3M guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers. The Company expects to receive consideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. Contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table, but these commitments represent a small part of the Company\u2019s expected capital spending. The purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future but represent only those items for which the Company is contractually obligated. The majority of 3M\u2019s products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional commitment. For this reason, these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the Company\u2019s expected future cash outflows on a stand-alone basis.\n\n\u200b\n\nOther obligations, included in the preceding table within the caption entitled \u201cUnconditional purchase obligations and other\u201d include the current portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under ASC 740, which is expected to be paid out in cash in the next 12 months, when applicable. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term payments, or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time; therefore, the long-term portion of the total net tax liability of $961 million is excluded from the preceding table. In addition, the transition tax prescribed under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) is separately included in the table above. Refer to Note 10 for further details. Additionally, included within the caption entitled \u201cUnconditional purchase obligations and other\u201d are operating lease commitments that have not yet commenced, which as of December\u00a031, 2019, totaled approximately $23 million. These commitments pertain to 3M\u2019s right of use buildings.\n\n\u200b\n\nAs discussed in Note 13, the Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2019 and Company contributions to its U.S. and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in future years; therefore, amounts related to these plans are not included in the preceding table.\n\n\u200b\n\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMEN\n\nTS\n\n\u200b\n\nThe Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions. The Company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and \n\n49\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \n\nfloating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps.\n\n\u200b\n\nRefer to Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d, for further discussion of foreign exchange rates risk, interest rates risk, commodity prices risk and value at risk analysis.\n\n\u200b", "item7a": ">Item 7A. \n\nQuantitative\n\n and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\n\n\u200b\n\nIn the context of Item 7A, 3M is exposed to market risk due to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Changes in those factors could impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. Senior management provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities, determines certain of the Company\u2019s financial risk policies and objectives, and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization. Senior management also establishes certain associated procedures relative to control and valuation, risk analysis, counterparty credit approval, and ongoing monitoring and reporting.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity price swaps, and forward and option contracts. However, the Company\u2019s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties.\n\n\u200b\n\nForeign Exchange Rates Risk:\n\n\u200b\n\nForeign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company\u2019s net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. 3M is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the U.S. dollar. The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. 3M may dedesignate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction. The maximum length of time over which 3M hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions is 36 months. In addition, 3M enters into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset, in part, the impacts of certain intercompany activities (primarily associated with intercompany licensing arrangements and intercompany financing transactions). As circumstances warrant, the Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency denominated debt as hedging instruments to hedge portions of the Company\u2019s net investments in foreign operations. The dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the Company\u2019s foreign exchange forward and option contracts designated as either cash flow hedges or net investment hedges was $3.0 billion at December\u00a031, 2019. The dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the Company\u2019s foreign exchange forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments was $2.7 billion at December\u00a031, 2019. In addition, as of December\u00a031, 2019, the Company had 4.1 billion Euros in principal amount of foreign currency denominated debt designated as non-derivative hedging instruments in certain net investment hedges as discussed in Note 14 in the \u201cNet Investment Hedges\u201d section.\n\n\u200b\n\nInterest Rates Risk:\n\n\u200b\n\nThe Company may be impacted by interest rate volatility with respect to existing debt and future debt issuances. 3M manages interest rate risk and expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. In addition, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The dollar equivalent (based on inception date foreign currency exchange rates) gross notional amount of the Company\u2019s interest rate swaps at December\u00a031, 2019 was $1.1 billion. Additional details about 3M\u2019s long-term debt can be found in Note 12, including references to information regarding derivatives and/or hedging instruments, further discussed in Note 14, associated with the Company\u2019s long-term debt.\n\n\u200b\n\n50\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \n\nCommodity Prices Risk:\n\n\u200b\n\nThe Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps. The related mark-to-market gain or loss on qualifying hedges was included in other comprehensive income to the extent effective, and reclassified into cost of sales in the period during which the hedged transaction affected earnings. The Company may enter into other commodity price swaps to offset, in part, fluctuation and costs associated with the use of certain commodities and precious metals. These instruments are not designated in hedged relationships and the extent to which they were outstanding at December\u00a031, 2019 was not material.\n\n\u200b\n\nValue At Risk:\n\n\u200b\n\nThe value at risk analysis is performed annually to assess the Company\u2019s sensitivity to changes in currency rates, interest rates, and commodity prices. A Monte Carlo simulation technique was used to test the impact on after-tax earnings related to financial instruments (primarily debt), derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at December\u00a031, 2019. The model (third-party bank dataset) used a 95 percent confidence level over a 12-month time horizon. The exposure to changes in currency rates model used 9 currencies, interest rates related to three currencies, and commodity prices related to five commodities. This model does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the Company. This model does not include certain hedge transactions, because the Company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results. The following table summarizes the possible adverse and positive impacts to after-tax earnings related to these exposures.\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nAdverse\u00a0impact\u00a0on\u00a0after-tax\n\n\u200b\n\nPositive\u00a0impact\u00a0on\u00a0after-tax\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nearnings\n\n\u200b\n\nearnings\n\n\u00a0\n\n(Millions)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n2018\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n2018\n\n\u00a0\n\nForeign exchange rates\n\n\u200b\n\n$\n\n (133)\n\n\u200b\n\n$\n\n (290)\n\n\u200b\n\n$\n\n 137\n\n\u200b\n\n$\n\n 305\n\n\u200b\n\nInterest rates\n\n\u200b\n\n\u00a0\n\n (11)\n\n\u200b\n\n\u00a0\n\n (20)\n\n\u200b\n\n\u00a0\n\n 10\n\n\u200b\n\n\u00a0\n\n 17\n\n\u200b\n\nCommodity prices\n\n\u200b\n\n\u00a0\n\n (2)\n\n\u200b\n\n\u00a0\n\n (6)\n\n\u200b\n\n\u00a0\n\n 1\n\n\u200b\n\n\u00a0\n\n 8\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nAn analysis of the global exposures related to purchased components and materials is performed at each year-end.

Global energy exposure includes energy costs used in 3M production and other facilities, primarily electricity and natural gas.\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b"}, "18": {"item1a": ">Item 1A. \n\nRisk Factor\n\ns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the Company. Discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of Part\u00a0II,\u00a0Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\u00a0Results are impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic, political, and capital markets conditions.\n\n The Company operates in more than 70 countries and derives approximately 60 percent of its revenues from outside the United States. The Company\u2019s business is subject to global competition and geopolitical risks and may be adversely affected by factors in the United States and other countries that are beyond its control, such as slower economic growth, disruptions in financial markets, economic downturns in the form of either contained or widespread recessionary \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\nconditions, inflation, elevated unemployment levels, sluggish or uneven recovery, government deficit reduction and other austerity measures in specific countries or regions, or in the various industries in which the Company operates; social, political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions; natural and other disasters or climate change affecting the operations of the Company or its customers and suppliers; or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital, interest rates, tax rates, tax laws, or exchange control, ability to expatriate earnings and other regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\u00a0Change in the Company\u2019s credit ratings could increase cost of funding.\n\n The Company\u2019s credit ratings are important to 3M\u2019s cost of capital. The major rating agencies routinely evaluate the Company\u2019s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3M. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include financial strength, business and financial risk, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. 3M currently has an AA- credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard\u00a0& Poor\u2019s and has an A1 credit rating with a stable outlook from Moody\u2019s Investors Service. The Company\u2019s credit ratings have served to lower 3M\u2019s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders. The addition of further leverage to the Company\u2019s capital structure could impact 3M\u2019s credit ratings in the future. Failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings would adversely affect the Company\u2019s cost of funding and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\u00a0The Company\u2019s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences.\n\n Demand for the Company\u2019s products, which impacts revenue and profit margins, is affected by (i)\u00a0the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products; (ii)\u00a0the Company\u2019s response to downward pricing to stay competitive; (iii)\u00a0changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in the Company\u2019s incentive programs, or the customer\u2019s ability to achieve incentive goals; and (iv)\u00a0changes in customers\u2019 preferences for our products, including the success of products offered by our competitors, and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the Company\u2019s products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\u00a0Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company\u2019s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings. \n\nBecause the Company\u2019s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and approximately 60 percent of the Company\u2019s revenues are derived from outside the United States, the Company\u2019s results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the U.S. dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\u00a0The Company\u2019s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings, including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market.\n\n This ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as the inability to identify viable new products, obtain adequate intellectual property protection, or gain market acceptance of new products. There are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\u00a0The Company\u2019s future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components, compounds, raw materials and energy, including oil and natural gas and their derivatives, due to shortages, increased demand, supply interruptions, currency exchange risks, natural disasters and other factors.\n\n The Company depends on various components, compounds, raw materials, and energy (including oil and natural gas and their derivatives) supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products. It is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural and other disasters and other events, or be terminated in the future. Any sustained interruption in the Company\u2019s receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, while the Company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\u00a0Acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies, and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results. \n\nThe Company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures and changes to its organizational structure.

Business transformation is defined as changes in processes and internal/external service delivery across 3M to move to more efficient business models to improve operational efficiency and productivity, while allowing 3M to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency. This is enabled by the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis. There can be no assurance that all of the projected productivity improvements will be realized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\u00a0The Company employs information technology systems to support its business, including ongoing phased implementation of an ERP system as part of business transformation on a worldwide basis over the next several years. Security breaches and other disruptions to the Company\u2019s information technology infrastructure could interfere with the Company\u2019s operations, compromise information belonging to the Company or its customers, suppliers, and employees, exposing the Company to liability which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business and reputation. \n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company relies on information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. Additionally, the Company collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. Despite our cybersecurity measures (including employee and third-party training, monitoring of networks and systems, patching, maintenance, and backup of systems and data), the Company\u2019s information technology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers, breaches, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, service or cloud provider breaches, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. It is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended period, up to and including several years. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats to the Company\u2019s information technology networks and infrastructure, none of them to date has had a material impact to the Company. There may be other challenges and risks as the Company upgrades and standardizes its ERP system on a worldwide basis. Any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. Although the Company maintains insurance coverage for various cybersecurity risks, there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\u00a0The Company's defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our results.\n\n The performance of financial markets and discount rates impact the Company's funding obligations under its defined benefit plans. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets, and relevant legislative or regulatory changes relating to defined benefit plan funding may increase the Company's funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\u00a0The Company\u2019s future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings and legal compliance risks, including those involving product liability, antitrust, intellectual property, environmental, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery, anti-corruption, or other matters.\n\n The outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the Company\u2019s expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to reliably predict. Various factors or developments can lead the Company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period.

For the full year 2017, net income attributable to 3M was $4.858 billion, or $7.93 per diluted share, compared to $5.050 billion, or $8.16 per diluted share, for the full year 2016, a decrease of 2.8 percent on a per diluted share basis. Excluding the 2017 impact related to TCJA, net income was $5.620 billion, or $9.17 per diluted share, an increase of 12.4 percent on a per diluted share basis compared to 2016. The Company refers to various measures excluding the 2017 net impact of enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. These non-GAAP measures are further described and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the section that follows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganic growth/productivity in 2017 includes benefits from higher organic local-currency sales, raw material cost decreases from sourcing cost reduction projects, and business transformation, which is having a positive impact on 3M\u2019s productivity efforts. These benefits were partially offset by higher defined benefit pension expenses. During both the fourth quarter and full year 2017, organic growth and productivity were the primary drivers for the year-on-year benefit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcquisitions and divestitures decreased earnings per diluted share by 2 cents year-on-year for the fourth quarter of 2017, while increasing earnings per diluted share by 54 cents year-on-year for the full year 2017. Acquisition impacts, which are measured for the first twelve months post-transaction, relate primarily to the acquisition of Scott Safety (fourth quarter 2017). The net impact related to Scott Safety includes income from operations, more than offset by the transaction and integration costs of the acquisition. Interest expense related to financing costs of Scott Safety are also included. The net impact related to Scott Safety was equivalent to a year-on-year decrease of 7 cents per diluted share. Full year 2017 had year-on-year operating income impacts from the following divestitures: Polyfoam and the remaining portion of the library system business (both in first quarter 2016), protective films business and cathode battery technology out-license business (both in fourth quarter 2016), prescription safety eyewear business (January 2017), identity management business and tolling and automated license/number plate recognition business (both in the second quarter of 2017), and electronic monitoring business (fourth quarter 2017). The incremental year-on-year pre-tax gain on divestiture impact, net of lost operating loss/(income) during the fourth quarter of 2017 was $26 million, or approximately 5 cents per diluted share. For the full year 2017, the year-on-year net pre-tax increase from divestitures was approximately $474 million, which is equivalent to a year-on-year increase of 61 cents per diluted share (primarily related to the identity management business). Additional discussion on divestitures is provided later within the \u201cDivestitures and Strategic Investments\u201d section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating income results include year-on-year incremental strategic investments that decreased pre-tax earnings by approximately $51 million and $413 million in the fourth quarter and full year 2017, respectively. These incremental strategic investments are comprised of 3M\u2019s investments in growth initiatives and optimization of its portfolio and supply chain footprint. Additional discussion on strategic investments is provided later within the \u201cDivestitures and Strategic Investments\u201d section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, as a result of the Company\u2019s regular review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities, the Company increased its accruals. This incremental increase resulted in a year-on-year decrease of 7 cents per diluted share. Refer to Note 15 for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeign currency impacts (net of hedging) decreased pre-tax earnings by approximately $3 million and $111 million year-on-year in the fourth quarter and full year 2017, respectively, excluding the impact of foreign currency changes on tax rates. This had a minimal impact per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017, and is equivalent to a year-on-year decrease of 13 cents per diluted share for the full year 2017. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeighted-average diluted shares outstanding in the fourth quarter and full year 2017 declined 0.1 percent and 1.0 percent year-on-year, respectively, which benefited earnings per share.

The early extinguishment of debt resulted in a charge of $96 million, which contributed to a year-on-year decrease of 11 cents per diluted share for both the fourth quarter and full year 2017.

The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter 2017 was 68.6 percent, an increase of 40.4 percentage points versus 2016. Excluding the impact of TCJA, the effective income tax rate was 23.0 percent in the fourth quarter 2017, a decrease of 5.2 percentage points versus 2016. For the full year 2017, the effective tax rate was 35.5 percent, an increase of 7.2 percentage points versus 2016. Excluding the impact of TCJA, the effective income tax rate was 25.4 percent in the full year 2017, a decrease of 2.9 percentage points versus 2016. Excluding the impact of TCJA, the fourth quarter and full year 2017 change in tax rate was driven largely by increasing benefits from our supply chain centers of expertise, favorable geographic mix and other items, as referenced in Note 9. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome, earnings per share, and effective tax rate adjusted for impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) - \u00a0(non-GAAP measures):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, 3M recorded a net tax expense of $762 million related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The expense is primarily related to the TCJA\u2019s transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and is net of remeasurement of 3M\u2019s deferred tax assets and liabilities considering the TCJA\u2019s newly enacted tax rates and certain other impacts. This provisional amount is subject to adjustment during the measurement period of up to one year following the December 2017 enactment of the TCJA, as provided by recent SEC guidance. See additional information in Note 9. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company also provides non-GAAP measures that adjust for the net impact of enactment of the TCJA. This item represents a significant charge that impacted the Company\u2019s financial results. Income, earnings per share, and the effective tax rate are all measures for which 3M provides the reported GAAP measure and an adjusted measure. The adjusted measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP measures. The Company considers these non-GAAP measures in evaluating and managing the Company\u2019s operations. The Company believes that discussion of results adjusted for this item is meaningful to investors as it provides a useful analysis of ongoing underlying operating trends. The determination of this item may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree\u00a0months\u00a0ended\u00a0December\u00a031,

selling prices, lower raw material costs, and productivity benefits related to the fourth quarter 2015 restructuring. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of flat organic sales and lower asset utilization. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcquisition and divestiture impacts, which are measured for the first twelve months post-transaction, related to the acquisitions of Membrana and Capital Safety (third quarter 2015) and Semfinder (September 2016), and the divestitures of Polyfoam (first quarter 2016), the library systems business (fourth quarter 2015/first quarter 2016), and the license plate converting business in France (fourth quarter 2015). In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2016, 3M sold the assets of its protective films business and its cathode battery technology out-licensing business. On a combined basis, these acquisition/divestiture year-on-year impacts resulted in a 14 cents per diluted share benefit to earnings per share in 2016, driven by solid performances from 2015 acquisitions and year-on-year divestiture gains. Refer to Note 2 for further discussion of these acquisition/divestiture impacts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestructuring actions (included within incremental strategic investments in the preceding table) resulted in an after-tax charge of 14 cents per diluted share in 2015, which provided a year-on-year benefit in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeign exchange impacts (net of hedging) decreased pre-tax earnings by approximately $127 million year-on-year in 2016, excluding the impact of foreign currency changes on tax rates. This was equivalent to a year-on-year decrease of 14 cents per diluted share for 2016. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeighted-average diluted shares outstanding\u00a0\u00a0in 2016 declined 3 percent versus 2015, which benefited earnings per share. The benefits from share repurchases, net of issuances, were partially offset by the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, which increased the calculated number of diluted shares in 2016. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigher average debt balances led to an increase in interest expense year-on-year in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe income tax rate was 28.3 percent in 2016, a decline of 0.8 percentage points versus last year.

Organic sales declined in advanced materials. Operating income margins were 19.4 percent, down 2.5 percentage points, with the decline driven by incremental strategic investments and a fourth quarter 2016 gain on sale of the temporary protective films business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00b7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Safety and Graphics, total sales increased 15.0 percent, or 10.7 percent on an organic local currency basis. Organic sales grew in all businesses, led by personal safety, roofing granules, and transportation safety.

This followed an increase of\u00a0\u00a0$242 million when comparing 2016 to 2015. Refer to the section entitled \u201cFinancial Condition and Liquidity\u201d later in MD&A for a discussion of items impacting cash flows. In February\u00a02016, 3M\u2019s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M\u2019s outstanding common stock. This program has no pre-established end date. In 2017, the Company purchased $2.1 billion of its own stock, compared to purchases of $3.8 billion in 2016 and $5.2 billion in 2015. The Company expects to purchase $2.0 billion to $5.0 billion of its own stock in 2018. In January\u00a02018, 3M\u2019s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2018 dividend of $1.36 per share, an increase of 16 percent. This marked the 60th consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M.

These efforts more than offset increasing costs in certain raw material categories in oil-derivative chemical feedstock markets. Oil-derivative cost increases also impact other feedstock categories, including petroleum based materials, minerals, metals and wood pulp based products. To date, the Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is difficult to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories, strategic relationships with key suppliers, and development and qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPension and postretirement defined benefit/contribution plans:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a worldwide basis, 3M\u2019s pension and postretirement plans were 87 percent funded at year-end 2017. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan, which is approximately 67 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 94 percent funded and the international pension plans were 90 percent funded. The U.S. non-qualified pension plan is not funded due to tax considerations and other factors. Asset returns in 2017 for the primary U.S. qualified pension plan were 12.4%, as 3M strategically invests in both growth assets and fixed income matching assets to manage its funded status. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2018 is 7.25%, consistent with 2017. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan year-end 2017 discount rate was 3.68%, down 0.53 percentage points from the year-end 2016 discount rate of 4.21%. The decrease in U.S. discount rates resulted in an increased valuation of the projected benefit obligation (PBO). The primary U.S. qualified pension plan\u2019s funded status increased 4 percentage points in 2017 as strong plan assets returns and $800 million in contributions increased asset values in excess of the higher PBO due to the significant discount rate decline. Additional detail and discussion of international plan asset returns and discount rates is provided in Note 12 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3M expects to contribute approximately $300 million to $500 million of cash to its global defined benefit pension and postretirement plans in 2018. The Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2018. 3M expects global defined benefit pension and postretirement expense in 2018 (before settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) to increase by approximately $76 million pre-tax when compared to 2017.

In addition, the Company divested certain businesses as it continued to focus its portfolio on opportunities that create greater value for its shareholders. As shown below, these divestitures and strategic investments led to a net year-on-year decrease of approximately $0.01 per diluted share and a benefit of $0.10 per diluted share, respectively, for the

increased in 2017 versus 2016, driven by gains from sale of businesses, partially offset by cost of sales increases. A number of factors impact the various income statement line items, such as raw material cost management, strategic investments, divestitures, foreign currency, cost management, and pension and postretirement effects. Expanded discussion of each of the income statement line items follows in the various sections below. Pension and postretirement expense is recorded in cost of sales; selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A); and research, development and related expenses (R&D). In total, 3M\u2019s defined benefit pension and postretirement expense increased $82 million in 2017, compared to a decrease of $305 million in 2016. Refer to Note 12 (Pension and Postretirement Plans) for components of net periodic benefit cost and the assumptions used to determine net cost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company is investing in business transformation. Business transformation is defined as changes in processes and internal/external service delivery across 3M to move to more efficient business models to improve operational efficiency and productivity, while allowing 3M to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency. This is enabled by the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2017, as referenced above in the \u201cDivestitures and strategic investments\u201d section, 3M incurred $413 million in incremental strategic actions, primarily reported within the cost of sales and SG&A income statement line items.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf these strategic investments, 3M incurred $96 million (net of adjustments) in restructuring actions and $47 million in exit activities during 2017. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2015, 3M incurred $114 million in restructuring charges.

This was partially offset by a year-on-year reduction in raw material input costs as a result of sourcing cost reduction projects. Selling prices were flat year-on-year for the full year 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost of sales as a percent of sales decreased in 2016 due to the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases, as selling prices increased net sales by 0.7 percent and raw material cost deflation was favorable by approximately 3.5 percent year-on-year. In addition, cost of sales as a percent of sales benefited from lower defined benefit pension and postretirement costs. Fourth quarter 2015 restructuring charges also provided a favorable year-on-year comparison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSG&A increased $350 million year-on year, or 5.6 percent, during 2017 due to incremental strategic investments and higher defined benefit pension expense. SG&A decreased $7 million, or 0.1 percent, in 2016 when compared to 2015, with 2016 results benefiting from foreign currency translation, and productivity benefits related to the fourth quarter 2015 restructuring. In addition, SG&A in 2016 benefited from lower defined benefit pension and postretirement expense.

On a combined basis, these divestitures resulted in a gain on the sale of businesses of $586 million. 3M also divested certain businesses in 2016 and 2015, resulting in gains of $111 million and $47 million, respectively.

Acquisitions and divestitures consist of the transactions and integration costs, net of income, that relate to the acquisition of Scott Safety, in addition to the year-on-year divestiture gains (refer to Note 2) and non-repeating operating losses from divested businesses, which combined, reduced operating margins in the fourth quarter of 2017 and benefited operating income margins for the full year 2017. Items that reduced operating margins were incremental strategic investments in growth, productivity and portfolio actions, in addition to charges related to 3M\u2019s optimization of its portfolio and supply chain footprint.

Acquisitions and divestitures had a favorable impact on operating margins. This included solid performances from both the Capital Safety and Membrana acquisitions. Divestiture impacts relate to the Polyfoam business, the library systems business, and the license plate converting business in France. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2016, 3M sold the assets of its protective films business and its cathode battery technology out-licensing business. Items that reduced operating income margins included 2016 strategic investments, as 3M took actions to better optimize its manufacturing footprint and accelerated growth investments across its businesses. Foreign currency impacts (net of hedging) also reduced operating income margins. Organic volume, productivity, and other decreased operating margins as a result of lower asset utilization, primarily in the Industrial, and Electronics and Energy businesses. Also, 3M had an unfavorable arbitration ruling on an insurance claim, commercial litigation settlements related to Andover Healthcare and TransWeb, and accruals for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities. These declines within organic volume, productivity, and other were partially offset by 2015 restructuring charges, which provided a favorable year-on-year comparison, and productivity benefits in 2016 related to the 2015 restructuring actions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Expense (Income), Net:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee Note 5 for a detailed breakout of this line item.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest expense increased during 2017 and 2016 due to higher average debt balances and higher U.S. borrowing costs.

The effective tax rate for 2016 was 28.3 percent, compared to 29.1 percent in 2015, a decrease of 0.8 percentage points. The changes in the tax rates between years were impacted by many factors, including the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in December 2017 as further described in the Overview, \u201c\n\nIncome, earnings per share, and effective tax rate adjusted for impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) -(non-GAAP measures)\u201d \n\nsection and in Note 9. During the fourth quarter of 2017, 3M recorded a net tax expense of $762 million related to the enactment of the TCJA. The expense is primarily related to the TCJA\u2019s transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and is net of remeasurement of 3M\u2019s deferred tax assets and liabilities considering the TCJA\u2019s newly enacted tax rates and certain other impacts. This provisional amount is subject to adjustment during the measurement period of up to one year following the December 2017 enactment of the TCJA, as provided by recent SEC guidance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe TCJA establishes new tax laws that will also affect 2018 and future periods, including, but not limited to: 1) reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, 2) the creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax (BEAT), 3) the creation of a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI), 4) a \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\ngeneral elimination of U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries, 5) limitations on the use of foreign tax credits to reduce the U.S. income tax liability, 6) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation, and 7) the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction. Considering the impacts of the TCJA and other factors, the Company currently estimates its effective tax rate for 2018 will be approximately 20 to 22 percent. The tax rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete items, such as the settlement of income tax audits, changes in tax laws, measurement period adjustment effects on the provisional items and remaining analyses to complete noted in Note 9 related to the 2017 impact of the TCJA, employee share-based payment accounting; as well as recurring factors, such as the geographic mix of income before taxes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRefer to Note 9 for further discussion of income taxes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Millions)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the elimination of the income or loss attributable to non-3M ownership interests in 3M consolidated entities.

Financial information and other disclosures are provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective in the first quarter of 2017, as part of 3M\u2019s continuing effort to improve the alignment of its businesses around markets and customers, the Company made the following changes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegration of former Renewable Energy Division\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00b7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3M\u2019s former Renewable Energy Division (RED) has been integrated into existing divisions within the Electronics and Energy business segment and Safety and Graphics business segment. 3M is committed to leadership in sustainability and to enabling the advancement of energy solutions into the future. Integrating RED\u2019s offerings into larger divisions already serving these segments will provide increased scale and build on strength by leveraging 3M\u2019s existing brands, go-to-market capabilities, and relationships to support growth objectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreation of Automotive and Aerospace Solutions Division\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00b7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3M created the Automotive and Aerospace Solutions Division, which combined the former Automotive Division and Aerospace and Commercial Transportation Division, which were both within the Industrial business segment. Combining the strengths along with the deep industry knowledge of each business will enable this new division to utilize shared technology platforms and processes to deliver a broader set of innovative solutions, along with world-class quality and service to 3M\u2019s customers. This combination will help accelerate the Company\u2019s profitable growth and market relevance across the automotive, aerospace and commercial transportation industries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsolidation of U.S. customer account activity - impacting dual credit reporting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00b7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company consolidated its customer account activity in the U.S. into more centralized sales districts. This improved alignment reduces the complexity for customers when interacting with multiple businesses within 3M, creating a better customer experience. 3M business segment reporting measures include dual credit to business segments for certain U.S. sales and related operating income. This dual credit is based on which business segment provides customer account activity with respect to a particular product sold in the U.S. The alignment of U.S. customer accounts to fewer, more focused sales districts changed the attribution of dual credit across 3M\u2019s business segments. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness segment information presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. 3M manages its operations in five business segments. The reportable segments are Industrial; Safety and Graphics; Health Care; Electronics and Energy; and Consumer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate and Unallocated:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to these five business segments, 3M assigns certain costs to \u201cCorporate and Unallocated,\u201d which is presented separately in the preceding business segments table and in Note 17. Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, such as corporate investment gains and losses, certain derivative gains and losses, certain insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and environmental expenses, corporate restructuring charges and certain under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension, stock-based compensation) that the Company determines not to allocate directly to its business segments. Because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate and Unallocated operating expenses increased by $80 million in 2017 when compared to 2016. In both the first and second quarters of 2017, a portion of the severance actions were reflected in Corporate and Unallocated. In the fourth quarter, an incremental $58 million was reflected within Corporate and Unallocated related to the Company\u2019s actuarial adjustments to its respirator mask/asbestos liability accrual.

In addition, the portion of the 2015 restructuring actions charged to corporate ($37 million) provided a favorable year-on-year comparison.

Export sales are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3M customers are made. A portion of the products or components sold by 3M\u2019s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas. As customers move their operations from one geographic area to another, 3M\u2019s results will follow. Thus, net sales in a particular geographic area are not indicative of end-user consumption in that geographic area.

manufacturing efficiency. In 2017, 62% of 3M\u2019s capital spending was within the United States, followed by Europe, Middle East and Africa; Asia Pacific; and Latin America/Canada. 3M is increasing its investment in manufacturing and sourcing capability in order to more closely align its product capability with its sales in major geographic areas in order to best serve its customers throughout the world with proprietary, automated, efficient, safe and sustainable processes. Capital spending is discussed in more detail later in MD&A in the section entitled \u201cCash Flows from Investing Activities.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMA\n\nTES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation regarding significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements. As stated in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.

The primary U.S. defined-benefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective January\u00a01, 2009. The Company accounts for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 715, \n\nCompensation \u2014 Retirement Benefits\n\n, in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost.

While the company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. See Note\u00a012 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining defined benefit pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant\u2019s years of service, compensation, and age at retirement or termination. The benefit obligation represents the present value of the benefits that employees are entitled to in the future for services already rendered as of the measurement date. The Company measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting benefit payment cash flows for each future period and discounting these cash flows back to the December 31 measurement date, using the yields of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Historically, the single aggregated discount rate used for each plan\u2019s benefit obligation was also used for the calculation of all net periodic benefit costs, including the measurement of the service and interest costs. Beginning in 2016, 3M changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs. The new method measures service cost and interest cost separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. Service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income. The Company changed to the new method to provide a more precise measure of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the discrete spot yield curve rates. The Company accounted for this change as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing this methodology, the Company determined discount rates for its plans as follow:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Qualified Pension\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational Pension (weighted average)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Postretirement Medical\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 31, 2017 Liability:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenefit obligation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 3.68\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 2.41\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 3.60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018 Net Periodic Benefit Cost Components:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService cost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 3.78\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 2.28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 3.77\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest cost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 3.35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 2.14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 3.20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother significant element in determining the Company\u2019s pension expense in accordance with ASC 715 is the expected return on plan assets, which is based on strategic asset allocation of the plan, long-term capital market return expectations, and expected performance from active investment management. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2018 is 7.25%, equal to 2017. Refer to Note 12 for information on how the 2017 rate was determined. Return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions.

Management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time. This includes the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses. These estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. For instance, expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the $2.9 billion in net identifiable intangible assets, $0.6 billion relates to indefinite-lived tradenames, primarily Capital Safety, whose tradenames ($520 million at acquisition date) have been in existence for over 55 years (refer to Note 2 for more detail). The primary valuation technique used in estimating the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets (tradenames) is a discounted cash flow approach. Specifically, a relief of royalty rate is applied to estimated sales, with the resulting amounts then discounted using an appropriate market/technology discount rate. The relief of royalty rate is the estimated royalty rate a market participant would pay to acquire the right to market/produce the product. If the resulting discounted cash flows are less than the book value of the indefinite lived intangible asset, impairment exists, and the asset value must be written down. Based on impairment testing in the third quarter of 2017, no impairment was indicated. The discounted cash flows related to the Capital Safety tradename exceeded its book value by more than 15 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3M goodwill totaled approximately $10.5 billion as of December\u00a031, 2017. 3M\u2019s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of each year. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but are required to be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. At 3M, reporting units correspond to a division. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit\u2019s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, and the loss would equal that difference. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3M typically uses the price/earnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows. 3M uses the discounted cash flow approach for start-up, loss position and declining businesses, in addition to using for businesses where the price/earnings ratio valuation method indicates additional review is warranted. 3M also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs described in Note 17, effective in the first quarter of 2017, 3M made business segment reporting changes. For any product moves that resulted in reporting unit changes, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed. The discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2017 annual impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of October\u00a01, 2017, 3M had 24 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 86 percent of the goodwill. These ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: Advanced Materials, Communication Markets, Display Materials and Systems, Health Information Systems,\u00a0Industrial Adhesives and \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n41\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\nTapes,\u00a0Infection Prevention, Oral Care Solutions, Personal Safety, Separation and Purification, and Transportation Safety. The estimated fair value for all reporting units was in excess of carrying value by approximately 40 percent or more. 3M\u2019s market value at both December 31, 2017, and September 30, 2017, was significantly in excess of its shareholders\u2019 equity of approximately $12 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs discussed in Note 2, 3M announced the sale of substantially all of its Communication Markets division, which is expected to close in 2018, which will result in an associated goodwill reduction of approximately $270 million upon sale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2017, 3M determined fair values using either an industry price-earnings ratio approach or a discounted cash flows analysis. Where applicable, 3M used a weighted-average discounted cash flow analysis for certain divisions, using projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions, among other factors. The weighting was based on management\u2019s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3M is a highly integrated enterprise, where businesses share technology and leverage common fundamental strengths and capabilities, thus many of 3M\u2019s businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3M\u2019s focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3M\u2019s value being comprised of internally developed businesses that have no goodwill associated with them. Based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2017, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactors which could result in future impairment charges include, among others, changes in worldwide economic conditions, changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These risk factors are discussed in Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d of this document. In addition, changes in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing results. As indicated above, during the first quarter of 2017, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by changes between reporting units and determined that no impairment existed. Long-lived assets with a definite life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. If future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3M would expect that only a portion of the long-lived assets or goodwill would be impaired. 3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2018 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome Taxes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe extent of 3M\u2019s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The Company follows guidance provided by ASC 740,\u00a0\n\nIncome Taxes\n\n, regarding uncertainty in income taxes, to record these liabilities (refer to Note 9 for additional information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company\u2019s current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the Company\u2019s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, 3M recorded a net tax expense related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The expense is primarily related to the TCJA\u2019s transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and is net of remeasurement of 3M\u2019s deferred tax assets and liabilities considering the TCJA\u2019s newly enacted tax rates and certain other impacts. As discussed in Note 9, this expense is a provisional amount and is subject to adjustment during the measurement period of up to one year following the December 2017 enactment of the TCJA, as provided by recent SEC guidance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEM\n\nENTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDI\n\nTY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe strength and stability of 3M\u2019s business model and strong free cash flow capability, together with proven capital markets access, positions the Company to be able to add further leverage to its capital structure. Investing in 3M\u2019s businesses to drive organic growth remains the first priority for capital deployment, including research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. Investment in organic growth will be supplemented by complementary acquisitions. 3M will also continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Sources for cash availability in the United States, such as ongoing cash flow from operations and access to capital markets, have historically been sufficient to fund dividend payments to shareholders, as well as funding U.S. acquisitions and other items as needed. The TCJA creates additional repatriation opportunities for 3M to access international cash positions on a continual and on-going basis and will help support U.S. capital deployments needs. For those international earnings still considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. See Note 9 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3M\u2019s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3M\u2019s commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. At December 31, 2017, there was approximately $745 million in commercial paper issued and outstanding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Debt:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe strength of 3M\u2019s capital structure and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company\u2019s maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. 3M currently has an AA- credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard\u00a0& Poor\u2019s and has an A1 credit rating with a stable outlook from Moody\u2019s Investors Service. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s total debt was $2.3 billion higher at December 31, 2017 when compared to December\u00a031, 2016. Increases in debt related to October 2017 debt issuances of $2.0 billion, commercial paper of $745 million outstanding at year end 2017, and the net impact of repayments and borrowings of international subsidiaries along with foreign currency effects. These are partially offset by June 2017 repayments of $650 million aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes and the October 2017 $305 million debt tender. For discussion of repayments of and proceeds from debt refer to the following \u201cCash Flows from Financing Activities\u201d section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffective February\u00a024, 2017, the Company updated its \u201cwell-known seasoned issuer\u201d (WKSI) shelf registration statement, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future issuance and sale. This replaced 3M\u2019s previous shelf registration dated May\u00a016, 2014. In May 2016, in connection with the WKSI shelf, 3M entered into an amended and restated distribution agreement relating to the future issuance and sale (from time to time) of the Company\u2019s medium-term notes program (Series F), up to the aggregate principal amount of $18 billion, which was an increase from the previous aggregate principal amount up to $9 billion of the same Series.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2017, the total amount of debt issued as part of the medium-term notes program (Series F), inclusive of debt issued in 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, and the 2017 debt referenced above, is approximately $13.1 billion (utilizing the foreign exchange rates applicable at the time of issuance for the Euro denominated debt). Information with respect to long-term debt issuances and maturities for the periods presented is included in Note 11. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn March 2016, 3M amended and restated its existing $2.25 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in August 2019 to a $3.75 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in March 2021. This credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to $1.25 billion (at lenders\u2019 discretion), bringing the total facility up to $5.0 billion. This revolving credit facility is undrawn at December 31, 2017.

This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2017, this ratio was approximately 29 to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends. Apart from the committed facilities, an additional $288 million in stand-alone letters of credit and bank guarantees were also issued and outstanding at December 31, 2017. These instruments are utilized in connection with normal business activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt December 31, 2017, 3M had $4.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $3.975 billion was held by the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries and approximately $180 million was held by the United States. These balances are invested in bank instruments and other high-quality fixed income securities. At December\u00a031, 2016, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries and by the United States totaled approximately $2.35 billion and $350 million, respectively.

Current asset balance changes increased working capital by $2.6 billion, driven by increases in cash/cash equivalents and marketable securities, in addition to higher accounts receivable and inventories (discussed further below). Current liability balance changes decreased working capital by $1.5 billion, largely due to increases in short-term borrowings, with commercial paper outstanding of $745 million at December 31, 2017 compared to none outstanding at December 31, 2016. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccounts Receivable and Inventory Turns (non-GAAP measures):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccounts receivable and inventory turns are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. 3M defines accounts receivable turns as quarterly net sales multiplied by 4 divided by ending accounts receivable \u2013 net, and defines inventory turns as quarterly manufacturing cost multiplied by 4 divided by ending inventory. 3M believes accounts receivable turns is meaningful to investors as a measure of how efficiently the Company manages credit and collects from its customers. For inventory turns calculation purposes, manufacturing cost is defined as cost of sales less freight and engineering costs. 3M believes inventory turns is meaningful to investors as a measure of how quickly inventory is sold.

Therefore, ROIC should not be considered a substitute for other measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines ROIC as adjusted net income (net income including non-controlling interest plus after-tax interest expense) divided by average invested capital (equity plus debt). The Company believes ROIC is meaningful to investors as it focuses on shareholder value creation.

funding decisions, tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2017, cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $422 million compared to the same period last year. Factors that decreased operating cash flows were increases in pension contributions, plus year-on-year increases in working capital. In December 2017, 3M contributed $600 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan, contributing to a year-on-year increase in pension and postretirement contributions of $584 million. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by $608 million in 2017, compared to working capital increases of $108 million in 2016. In 2017, year-on-year decreases in income tax payments (net of refunds) increased operating cash flows by $284 million. Additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the \u201cFinancial Condition and Liquidity\u201d section. Information concerning defined benefit pension and postretirement contributions and expense is provided in Note 12, with additional discussion in the preceding Results of Operations section. Gain on sale of businesses in the preceding table reflects an adjustment for divestiture gains in 2017 (discussed in Note 2), as cash divestiture activity is presented as proceeds from sale of businesses within investing activities, not operating activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2016, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $242 million compared to the same period in 2015, with this increase primarily due to lower year-on-year cash taxes and higher net income. These items were partially offset by higher Company pension contributions. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by $108 million in 2016, compared to working capital increase of $46 million in 2015. Gain on sale of businesses in the preceding table reflects an adjustment for divestiture gains in 2016 (discussed in Note 2), as cash divestiture activity is presented as proceeds from sale of businesses within investing activities, not operating activities. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash Flows from Investing Activities:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYears ended December\u00a031\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Millions)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment (PP&E)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (1,373)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (1,420)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (1,461)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProceeds from sale of PP&E and other assets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 58\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcquisitions, net of cash acquired\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (2,023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (16)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (2,914)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurchases and proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities\u00a0and\u00a0investments, net\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (798)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (163)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1,300\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProceeds from sale of businesses, net of cash sold\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1,065\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 142\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 123\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther \u2014 net\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 102\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash used in investing activities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (3,086)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (1,403)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (2,817)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n47\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency.

Increases in debt related to October 2017 debt issuances of $2.0 billion, commercial paper of $745 million outstanding at year end 2017, and the net impact of repayments and borrowings of international subsidiaries. These are partially offset by June 2017 repayments of $650 million aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes and the October 2017 $305 million debt tender. Net commercial paper issuances and repayments and borrowings by international subsidiaries are largely reflected in \u201cChange in short-term debt \u2013 net\u201d in the preceding table.

This increase was partially offset by the repayment of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes due September 2016 along with the net impact of repayments and borrowings by international subsidiaries, primarily Japan and Korea (approximately $0.8 million decrease), which is reflected in \u201cChange in short-term debt\u2014net\u201d in the preceding table.

Therefore, they should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures.

The expense is primarily related to the TCJA\u2019s transition tax. The transition tax is payable over 8 years at the election of the taxpayer. As discussed in Note 9, this balance is a provisional amount and is subject to adjustment during the measurement period of up to one year following the December 2017 enactment of the TCJA, as provided by recent SEC guidance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnconditional purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company. Included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts, capital commitments, service agreements and utilities. These estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year. Many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3M guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers. The Company expects to receive consideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. Contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table, but these commitments represent a small part of the Company\u2019s expected capital spending. The purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which the Company is contractually obligated. The majority of 3M\u2019s products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional commitment. For this reason, these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the Company\u2019s expected future cash outflows on a stand-alone basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther obligations, included in the preceding table within the caption entitled \u201cUnconditional purchase obligations and other,\u201d include the current portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under ASC 740, which is expected to be paid out in cash in the next 12 months.

The Company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRefer to Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d, for further discussion of foreign exchange rates risk, interest rates risk, commodity prices risk and value at risk analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "item7a": ">Item 7A. \n\nQuantitative\n\n and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the context of Item 7A, 3M is exposed to market risk due to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Changes in those factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows. Senior management provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities, determines certain of the Company\u2019s financial risk policies and objectives, and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization. Senior management also establishes certain associated procedures relative to control and valuation, risk analysis, counterparty credit approval, and ongoing monitoring and reporting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity price swaps, and forward and option contracts. However, the Company\u2019s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeign Exchange Rates Risk:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company\u2019s net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. 3M is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the U.S. dollar. The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. 3M may dedesignate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction. The maximum length of time over which 3M hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions is 36 months. In addition, 3M enters into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset, in part, the impacts of certain intercompany activities (primarily associated with intercompany licensing arrangements and intercompany financing transactions). As circumstances warrant, the Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency denominated debt as hedging instruments to hedge portions of the Company\u2019s net investments in foreign operations. The dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the Company\u2019s foreign exchange forward and option contracts designated as either cash flow hedges or net investment hedges was $3.6 billion at December 31, 2017. The dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the Company\u2019s foreign exchange forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments was $5.0 billion at December\u00a031, 2017. In addition, as of December\u00a031, 2017, the Company had 4.4 billion Euros in principal amount of foreign currency denominated debt designated as non-\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n52\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\nderivative hedging instruments in certain net investment hedges as discussed in Note 13 in the \u201cNet Investment Hedges\u201d section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest Rates Risk:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company may be impacted by interest rate volatility with respect to existing debt and future debt issuances. 3M manages interest rate risk and expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. In addition, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The dollar equivalent (based on inception date foreign currency exchange rates) gross notional amount of the Company\u2019s interest rate swaps at December\u00a031, 2017 was $2.0 billion. Additional details about 3M\u2019s long-term debt can be found in Note 11, including references to information regarding derivatives and/or hedging instruments, further discussed in Note 13, associated with the Company\u2019s long-term debt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommodity Prices Risk:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps. 3M used commodity price swaps as cash flow hedges of forecasted commodity transactions to manage price volatility, but discontinued this practice in the first quarter of 2015. The related mark-to-market gain or loss on qualifying hedges was included in other comprehensive income to the extent effective, and reclassified into cost of sales in the period during which the hedged transaction affected earnings. The Company may enter into other commodity price swaps to offset, in part, fluctuation and costs associated with the use of certain commodities and precious metals. These instruments are not designated in hedged relationships and the extent to which they were outstanding at December 31, 2017 was not material.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValue At Risk:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe value at risk analysis is performed annually to assess the Company\u2019s sensitivity to changes in currency rates, interest rates, and commodity prices. A Monte Carlo simulation technique was used to test the impact on after-tax earnings related to financial instruments (primarily debt), derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at December\u00a031, 2017. The model (third-party bank dataset) used a 95 percent confidence level over a 12-month time horizon. The exposure to changes in currency rates model used 9 currencies, interest rates related to two currencies, and commodity prices related to five commodities. This model does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the Company. This model does not include certain hedge transactions, because the Company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results.

This estimate includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies into U.S. dollars; the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3M operations in the United States and abroad; and transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks. 3M estimates that year-on-year derivative and other transaction gains and losses decreased pre-tax income by approximately $152 million and $69 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn analysis of the global exposures related to purchased components and materials is performed at each year-end.
