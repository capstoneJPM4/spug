2021-08-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/09/your-money/pandemic-working-from-home-retire.html," For Mona Janochoski, a chemist who ran a laboratory at 3M in St. Paul, Minn., working from home during the pandemic was the deciding factor. It was the first time in her career that she had not gone to an office every day. And she found that she enjoyed being home with her husband, Tom, who had retired as the chief financial officer of a trust company in 2017. Her daughter, who was a graduate student, was living with them, too. That got Ms. Janochoski thinking about something she hadn’t given much thought to before: quitting her job after 36 years and seeing what else life had in store. “When I was home during Covid, my husband really liked it,” Ms. Janochoski, 60, said. “He got used to the idea of me retiring. We kept going back to the adviser to make sure we could retire.” The pandemic forced many people into early, unplanned retirements, when they were laid off or their business could no longer survive. But many of those people were not high earners. Retirements in the pandemic by those at the top of the income ladder were often by choice. And for that slice of corporate employees, working from home for some or all of the pandemic scrambled their thinking on work and life. They had been working for decades in an office, and suddenly at home with a spouse, they began to see the possibility of a different life. “The vast majority of our clients have at least inquired about what their plan would look like if they retired earlier,” said Mike Leverty, founder of Leverty Financial Group, whose clients include a lot of executives at large Minnesota companies like 3M and Target. “We haven’t seen people want to delay retirement. They’re getting a flavor of what retirement will look like in working from home.” “Previously,” he added, “people wanted to max out the economic package, with various pension and long-term incentive plans. In the last year, we’ve been asked to redo a lot of plans, and people are OK if they’re leaving something on the table.” Deciding to retire early is about more than crunching the numbers, of course. It is also about psychologically preparing yourself to leave work and leave behind some part of your identity. “You need a discipline to work from home and not go into the office,” said Rainer Zitelmann, author of “The Wealth Elite” and “The Rich in Public Opinion.” “No one is watching you. In the pandemic, people started thinking about what else they wanted to do.” In Ms. Janochoski’s case, “retirement looked good” after all those months of working from home, she said. “I wasn’t going to go before April, when my stock options vested,” she added. “So I picked the end of May, and we ran through the numbers. It made sense.” Jesse Coffee, a wealth adviser at True Private Wealth Advisers, said that before the pandemic, it was generally clients around age 62 who were initiating pre-retirement talks with him. In the past year, that age has dropped to 54 or 55, he said. “People have realized what’s really important,” he said. “If you want to just go out and hike, it doesn’t cost a lot of money. If my lifestyle isn’t going to need all that much money, maybe I can move somewhere less expensive, have some low-cost hobbies and retire early. That and, frankly, the market has been great over the past 10 years.” An adviser’s job is, of course, to do the math on whether retirement is even possible and what it may look like. But leaving a career, particularly for people who have risen up at a company doing work they enjoy, is not an easy decision to make. Working from home in the pandemic gave some people a taste of what retirement could be like, something they would not have gotten if they had kept going into the office or traveling for work. “It’s allowed them to reset and take a step back,” Mr. Leverty said. He said there was no question that retiring early would reduce wealth, but that’s a trade-off for what could be more time — to spend with family, explore activities like charitable work or pursue new interests. A life-altering event four years ago got Mark Nagel thinking about retiring as soon as possible. When he slipped on ice and pulled a muscle, what seemed like a minor injury would result in the amputation of one of his legs. “Early retirement became a requirement at that point,” said Mr. Nagel, 55. “You just never know when something is going to happen. So why wait until next year? He worked for 31 years at Ecolab, the water and hygiene company, and said he had always told himself that when the stock topped $200 a share he would have enough to retire. “The pandemic hits, we had already hit the $200-a-share mark, but now the bottom is dropping out,” he said. “There were a few weeks when I said maybe this is not going to be the time. Or maybe this new lifestyle of 100 percent working where I want to work is not so bad.” “At the same time,” he added, “we had this goal and this plan. We knew what we had to do. As the stock started climbing, we decided to stick with the plan.” Mr. Nagel’s wife, Tammy, who will turn 55 this year, plans to work a few more years at Boston Scientific, he said. Mr. Coffee, the wealth adviser, said that for him, “it comes down to what you’re spending, especially in retirement when you don’t have the big paychecks coming in.” People with large incomes are “used to being able to spend money on whatever they want,” he said. “They’re taking the trips without thinking about the cost. In retirement, you have to put some thought behind it.” Craig DiLorenzo, who worked in international positions for 3M for 35 years, said that after the pandemic erased the barriers between work and personal life, he began thinking about retiring. “When you don’t go into the office anymore, you don’t own your time,” Mr. DiLorenzo said. “Most people head into the office at 7 a.m. or 8 a.m. and go home around 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. You lose that when everyone is working from home. You decide to meet at 6 a.m. because you have all these other meetings. Or it’s ‘Let’s have a Zoom call at 8 p.m. because we’re all free.’ You lose your personal time somewhat.” While Mr. DiLorenzo, 58, said he had always wanted to retire early, the loss of personal time at home coupled with losing the camaraderie that he had enjoyed in the office sped up his decision. He retired in April. “When you don’t need to work anymore and you’ve lost that camaraderie, you start to think, ‘I can do something else,’” he said. “My wife said go for it. I had spent 25 years of my career in our international division, so I was always traveling, often for two to three weeks at a time, or on the phone at odd hours when I wasn’t traveling.” The timing of Ms. Janochoski’s retirement was particularly good this year. Her youngest child, a daughter, just finished graduate school; one son is getting married; and her other son and his wife are expecting a baby. “I could have kept working from home, but I had a good run,” she said. “With everything going on with the kids and the baby coming, and we’re financially OK, this was as good a time as any.”",8,2021,2021_q3
2021-08-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/30/opinion/catholic-church-politics.html," A social historian looking for a defense of the Black Power movement in popular magazines and newspapers of the 1960s would have to do a great deal of digging. Such an inquirer would have an easier time quarrying the pages of Triumph, a little-remembered Catholic periodical started by L. Brent Bozell, a brother-in-law of William F. Buckley Jr., the founder of National Review. In January 1967, the editors of Triumph suggested that Black Power could help to restore “liberty and human dignity to America.” Liberals congratulating themselves over the passage of major civil rights legislation, the magazine argued, were unaware of how they were still “barbarizing” Black people, who rightly understood that human dignity transcended mere legal recognition of their constitutional rights. The editors would go even further than this. To these decidedly reactionary Roman Catholic laymen — Mr. Bozell had only recently returned with his family from Francisco Franco’s Spain — rioting was an understandable response to the “terror that always haunts men confronted by meaninglessness,” the actions of a people “yearning to make contact with the divine.” For Triumph, Black Power was a rebellion against the “soulless tyranny of secular liberalism,” and its adherents were worthy of praise because “almost alone among our brethren they seem willing to burst violently through the flesh into the realm of the spirit.” When I began reading through the archives of Triumph several years ago, I found these arguments striking. This was not because they seemed to offer a wholly accurate assessment of the state of American race relations in the late ’60s. (Among other things, many at the magazine ignored the reality that millions of African Americans were quite pleased with the decidedly sublunary consolations of equal protection under the law and held correspondingly unromantic views about rioting.) What struck me, rather, was that the editors, who also called for unilateral nuclear disarmament and were among the founders of the nascent pro-life movement, were doing something that even now, in a nation of some 65 million Catholics, seems impossibly radical: setting aside the standard ideological divisions of coalition politics in an attempt to apply the full range of the church’s social teaching to the problems of modern life. It is certainly difficult to imagine anything like the magazine’s defense of the Black Power movement appearing in a conservative Catholic periodical today. Last year, the radio host Gloria Purvis was fired from her position with the Eternal Word Television Network, the largest Catholic broadcasting company in the United States, after suggesting that her co-religionists should be outraged by the death of George Floyd. (Her dismissal would almost certainly have baffled the network’s founder, Mother Mary Angelica of the Annunciation, who was inspired by the civil rights movement to start a religious community near Birmingham, Ala., that would appeal to African American women.) Instead of commentary informed by the official teachings of the Catholic Church, much of what issues from the American Catholic press on the subject of race relations is indistinguishable from the competing perspectives on offer in secular media, with some Catholic liberals uncritically endorsing organizations such as Black Lives Matter, which has called for the displacement of the traditional nuclear family, and some on the right employing casuistry in defense of Mr. Floyd’s murder. This is the case despite the fact that on race and so many other issues, it is clear that distinctly Catholic positions — which is to say, responses formed by papal encyclicals, the lives and writings of the saints, the traditions of academic theology and natural law philosophy — do not line up with the mainstream of either progressive or conservative opinion in this country. This is why pronouncements from the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops often appear to those unfamiliar with the church’s social teaching as if they were the work of two very different entities: in favor of looser immigration policies, prudent stewardship of the environment and criminal sentencing reform, yet opposed to abortion, same-sex marriage and divorce. While it is certainly true that the relative weight assigned to each of these issues by individuals within the American episcopate varies, even the most “conservative” and “liberal” bishops are more likely to agree with one another than they are with prominent politicians in either of our two major political parties. I express these concerns about the integrity of the church’s public witness because I believe that a thoughtfully articulated Catholic politics has a great deal to offer our officially secular republic. After all, ever since St. John XXIII’s encyclical “Pacem in Terris” was addressed in 1963 to “all men of good will,” the implied audience for Catholic social teaching has extended well beyond the Catholic faithful, not least because the church has always maintained that moral truth is available to all men and women by the light of reason alone. Today, perhaps more than ever, the church presents a refreshing response to our nation’s enforced ideological bifurcation. Polling suggests that about 75 percent of Americans have moderate to progressive views on economic questions and slightly more than half are socially conservative. The median voter has both of these traits, and there are good reasons to think that it was this unnamed coalition of anti-libertarians who decided the outcomes of the last two presidential elections. Both of our major political parties try to placate voters by triangulating occasionally, tactically co-opting stances from the other side. But the most striking thing about both parties is the wide range of positions they share that are at odds with the enthusiasms of the median voter: a bellicose foreign policy, free trade, social libertinism and the financialization of the economy. In contrast, the church offers a consistent ethic of solidarity: against pre-emptive war of any kind (which the church tells us cannot be waged in a just manner under modern conditions), against the enrichment of the wealthy in poor and rich nations alike at the expense of the working and middle classes, against the increasingly nebulous claims of academic progressives and activists about the nature of the human person and against the pursuit of maximal shareholder value to the detriment of virtually every other meaningful consideration. It is not just the wide range of issues addressed by the church’s social teaching that might inform a future large-scale political realignment but also the manner in which it does so. Consider the problem of cooperation among nations. If the events of the last year have revealed anything, it is the importance of what Benedict XVI, the pope emeritus, referred to as supranational institutions with “real teeth.” Instead of lionizing the neoliberal banalities of Davos Man, Catholic social teaching articulates a morally inflected defense of internationalism that rejects most of what makes Americans suspicious of it — the obliging attitude toward corporate power, the soft cultural imperialism of liberal nongovernmental organizations — while insisting upon its indispensability for the common good. The idea that Catholic social teaching can inspire secular politics is not new. The papal encyclicals of the interwar period, which spoke to the anxieties of a world torn between the failures of laissez-faire economics and the growing threat of totalitarianism, were read enthusiastically by Franklin Roosevelt. Today Pope Francis, in keeping with many recent occupants of the Chair of Peter, addresses his writings to “all people of good will” rather than to the Catholic faithful alone as he inveighs against the spoliation of the Amazon region and its Indigenous peoples, wage slavery in Asia, the theft of natural resources in Africa and the replacement of civic life with algorithm-abetted consumerism in the developed world. We already have a test case for what Catholic social teaching can offer to a population disillusioned by the collapse of a civilization and its supposed ideals: the European political tradition of Christian democracy. More than half a century ago, Christian democracy arose in Europe as a response to the ideologies that had given rise to a global economic depression and two successive world wars. The new postnationalist Europe to which this political movement gave rise — a Europe of robust trade unions and generously subsidized orchestras — was the dream not only of the onetime imperial heir Otto von Hapsburg and Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani, the longtime prefect of the Holy Office, but also of Goethe and Schiller and Beethoven, the fulfillment of the promise of centuries of European humanism. Like its predecessor in Europe, a revived Christian democracy in the United States would draw upon official church teaching as well as pilfer from the best of secular culture. A new Catholic politics would “baptize” Bernie Sanders’s health care plan, degrowth economics and bans on single-use plastics while drawing attention to neglected elements of our own political heritage that really are worth preserving, such as the presumption of innocence. Such a politics would also remind us, in ways that transcend politics in the narrow sense, of the value of forgiveness and contrition, as opposed to the self-aggrandizing quasi-therapeutic apologies to which we have become accustomed from public figures. The prospects for a politics informed by the church’s social teaching will be limited, of course, in the absence of an equally thoughtful Catholic culture, one that allows us to escape what Cardinal Robert Sarah calls the “dictatorship of noise.” A Catholic culture worthy of the name would be a catholic one — which is to say, it would be capacious in spirit. It would model virtues such as gregariousness, intellectual curiosity and munificence. It would offer an unapologetic defense of leisure and innocent entertainment by showing us the innate worthiness of everything from public barbecue grills and minor league baseball to regional theater companies and the miracle of hi-fi recording. Such a culture would hold up to a world of faddishness those immortal words of St. Paul in his Epistle to the Philippians: “Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.” Matthew Walther (@matthewwalther) is the editor of The Lamp, a Catholic literary journal, and a contributing editor at The American Conservative.

2021-08-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/22/business/internet-outage.html," Dozens of consumer websites were reported to be offline or slow to load on Thursday afternoon, creating headaches for people trying to gain access to their accounts, but the issues were resolved shortly after. A range of companies had outages, including financial firms like American Express and Chase, retailers like Amazon and Home Depot and travel companies like Delta Air Lines and Expedia, according to the online platform Downdetector. On its website, Delta said that it was working to resolve “a technology issue” that was affecting “many global websites.” “You can continue to check in for flights at this time at the airport,” Delta’s statement said. The outages were reported as Akamai, one of the largest cloud-computing providers, said it had experienced problems with its DNS service, though it wasn’t immediately clear whether the Akamai outage was the source of all of the issues elsewhere. DNS, one of the most fundamental technologies of the web, helps route requests for a specific URL to the server where that website actually lives. Akamai also helps many companies make their sites faster and more reliable by serving cached versions of pages from around the globe, but an outage in its network could render those sites unusable. Akamai confirmed the connectivity issues were not the result of a cyberattack. “There are reports of issues related to a Content Delivery Network (Akamai) outside of Amazon’s Network,” Amazon Web Services said in a statement posted on its website. “We have investigated AWS services such as Amazon Route 53 and Amazon CloudFront and these services are all operating normally at this time.” Zomato, an Indian food delivery company, also blamed Akamai for its outage. “Our app is down, owing to a widespread internet outage (Akamai),” the company posted on Twitter. Just before 1 p.m. Eastern time, Akamai said it had resolved its issue. “We have implemented a fix for this issue, and based on current observations, the service is resuming normal operations,” Akamai said on Twitter. In an apparently unrelated incident, several counties in Virginia, including Campbell and Grayson, reported that their 911 systems were down. On its Facebook page, the Grayson County Sheriff’s Office said the outage was because of a cut to fiber internet lines and that 911 could still be reached from landline telephones.",8,2021,2021_q3
2021-08-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/us/politics/carl-levin-dead.html," Carl Levin, a liberal Michigan Democrat who served 36 years in the Senate and scared the wits out of America’s biggest C.E.O.s by demanding explanations for shadowy schemes that hid billions in profits overseas and avoided vast corporate taxes at home, died on Thursday in Detroit. He was 87. His death was confirmed by the Levin Center at Wayne State University. Mr. Levin had disclosed in March that he had lung cancer, Jim Townsend, a spokesman for the family, said. The longest-serving senator in Michigan history — from 1979 to 2015 — Mr. Levin was regarded by Senate colleagues and Washington observers as a paragon of probity as the chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. He wielded subpoena power, huge briefing books, a big gavel and an unquenchable zeal for grilling high-profile witnesses at public hearings. With his longish silver hair, affable smile and glasses perched low on the nose, he looked more like a kindly Old-World shoemaker than the terror of the Senate. But he confronted the titans of JPMorgan Chase, Apple, American Express and other corporate giants like a barbarian at the gates, and extracted admissions about overseas banking havens and mind-boggling tax-avoidance maneuvers that rendered profits invisible and made tax burdens vanish into thin air. “Levin has shown how profits can be shipped tax-free to the Cayman Islands and, amazingly, how Apple figured out that profits booked in Ireland could be hidden from tax authorities of both Ireland and the United States in a cloak of invisibility,” David Cay Johnston wrote in a 2014 essay, “The Legacy of Carl Levin,” in The American Prospect, a liberal quarterly. Mr. Johnston said Mr. Levin showed how Apple escaped $10 billion in taxes every year from 2009 to 2012; how Microsoft siphoned $8 billion to Singapore and Irish subsidiaries and lowered its effective tax rate on the money to 3 percent; and how Goldman Sachs sold clients securities that it later bet would fail, “eliciting eye-opening testimony from its C.E.O., Lloyd Blankfein, who saw nothing wrong with this.” Mr. Levin documented conflicts of interest and other wrongdoing that led to the 2008 financial crisis, which threatened global markets and produced the worst recession since the Great Depression. In 2013, a 300-page report by Mr. Levin’s panel detailed JPMorgan Chase’s $6.2 billion loss fiasco by rogue traders. “In corporate America, the scariest seat in Washington is the front row of a hearing room where Carl Levin holds the gavel,” Politico reported in 2014. “His retirement next January has executives exhaling.” Reginald Brown, a lawyer who represented several targets of Mr. Levin’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, told Politico: “The first thing I tell people is, PSI stands for ‘pretty scary investigations.’” Senator Levin, who was also known for opposing the war in Iraq and for advocating tighter controls over handguns and nuclear weapons, was one of his state’s most popular politicians — narrowly elected to the Senate on his first try, but re-elected five times by widening margins. He was the Senate’s fourth-longest serving incumbent when he retired at age 80. He was the most prominent member of a Michigan family that embraced public service. His brother, Sander Levin, a former United States representative, was the chairman of the powerful tax-writing Ways and Means Committee and had a congressional career of more than three decades that almost paralleled Carl’s. Other relatives were federal and state judges or held other elective or appointive offices. A nephew, Andy Levin, serves in the House as a Democrat representing a district north of Detroit. Carl Levin joined a class of 20 freshman senators in 1979 that included the Democrats Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, and the Republicans Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming and William S. Cohen of Maine. Many hit the ground running. Mr. Levin became floor manager of legislation to implement recently ratified Panama Canal treaties, and won a tough fight for more funds for child care. The liberal Mr. Levin and the conservative Mr. Simpson found that they shared a passion for baseball, and after a tour of defense installations in San Diego that summer they attended a Padres game together. Midway through the game, the scoreboard lit up: “Let’s give a Big Padres Welcome to Senator Simpson of Wyoming and Senator Levin of Michigan!” The stadium erupted in nonpartisan Bronx cheers. In 1981, Americans for Democratic Action, a national liberal organization, issued its ratings of senators’ voting records for the previous year. It gave its highest rating, 94 percent, to Mr. Levin, and its lowest, 0, to Senator Barry M. Goldwater, the Arizona Republican. Mr. Levin’s votes in the Senate over the decades were consistent with that early assessment, except on home-state issues like fuel economy for cars, which he opposed, and bailouts and other measures to aid Detroit’s automotive industries, which he backed enthusiastically. He supported funds for education, measures for environmental protections and trade regulations that, advocates said, improved public health and created jobs. He sponsored a ban on assault weapons, was rated “F” by the National Rifle Association and voted to ratify treaties to control nuclear weapons and ban intercontinental ballistic missiles. While he had no military experience, Senator Levin served for 10 years — from 2001 to 2003 and from 2007 to 2015 — as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, a platform from which he exerted a major influence on military appropriations and defense policies. He exposed wasteful and corrupt practices by military contractors, voted to close bases, pushed for less secrecy in government and was instrumental in lifting the ban on gays in the military. He argued that military commanders, not civilian officials, should retain authority over sexual assault cases in the armed forces, arguing that doing so would afford more protection for victims. After the 2001 terrorist attacks, he voted to give President George W. Bush authority to go after the perpetrators. But he grew critical of American fighting in Afghanistan and was an early opponent of the Iraq war, voicing skepticism over the administration’s claim that President Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. He hailed President Barack Obama’s 2011 decision to withdraw American troops from Iraq. Carl Milton Levin was born in Detroit on June 28, 1934, one of three children of Saul Levin and the former Bess Levinson. His father was a lawyer and member of Michigan’s Correction Commission, which ran state prisons. Public affairs dominated dinner conversations, the father asking Carl, his brother and sister, Hannah, for opinions on capital punishment, mayoral decisions and other topics. Carl graduated from Detroit Central High School in 1952, from Swarthmore College in 1956 with a bachelor’s degree in political science, and from Harvard Law School in 1959. He married Barbara Halpern in 1961. They had three daughters, Kate, Laura and Erica. He is survived by his wife, daughters, brother and six grandchildren. Mr. Levin lived in Detroit all his life. After five years practicing law in Detroit, he became an assistant attorney general and general counsel for the Michigan Civil Rights Commission from 1964 to 1967. He helped form the Detroit Public Defender’s office, and in 1968-69 was its chief appellate defender. He served two terms on the Detroit City Council from 1969 to 1977, the last four years as president. He also became a close associate of Coleman Young, a Democrat who in 1974 became Detroit’s first African American mayor. Mr. Levin defeated Republicans in six Senate races: the incumbent, Robert Griffin, in 1978; the former astronaut Jack R. Lousma in 1984; Representative Bill Schuette in 1990; Ronna Romney, a radio talk show host, in 1996; Andrew Raczkowski in 2002; and Jack Hoogendyk, a state representative, in 2008. Mr. Levin said in 2013 that he would not seek a seventh term. “I will miss Carl Levin when he leaves the Senate after the next election — and you will too,” Joe Nocera, then an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times, wrote at the time. “Levin has done more than anyone to expose the scams, the conflicts, the wrongdoing and the sheer idiocy of the financial industry from the run-up to the financial crisis to the present day.” Michael Levenson contributed reporting.",8,2021,2021_q3
2021-08-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/27/books/review/the-minister-primarily-john-oliver-killens.html," THE MINISTER PRIMARILYBy John Oliver Killens John Oliver Killens is hardly a household name today, but there was a time when the writer and activist — who was a close friend of Martin Luther King Jr., Langston Hughes, Maya Angelou and Harry Belafonte; was the founding chair of the Harlem Writers Guild; and was the godfather of the Black Arts Movement — was famous across America. In his writing, Killens always liked to bring his readers up close to uncomfortable truths about the United States. His South was a hellhole for African Americans, a place where people were routinely dragged from their homes and lynched. Three of Killens’s novels were nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. His fiction and activism were so powerful that the F.B.I. spied on him for nearly four decades, starting in 1941. So the discovery of an unpublished novel among Killens’s papers — a manuscript that was missing a dedication but not much else — was, therefore, cause for cheering. Almost 35 years after the author’s death in 1987, when he was 71, it is finally being published. The author’s daughter, Barbara Killens Rivera, chose to dedicate the book to her great-great-grandmother, Georgia Killens, who used to say to the novelist when he was a boy, “Ah lord honey, the half ain’t never been told.” Killens Rivera feels her father would have liked the challenge of trying to tell part of the other half. At the start of “The Minister Primarily,” an Elizabethan curtain-raiser sets the scene and introduces our two heroes: James Jay Leander Johnson, known as Jimmy Jay, a “colored, Negro, Afro-American, Black man, sepia fella, tan Yank (take your choice)” folk singer, and Jaja Okwu Olivamaki, the prime minister of the newly independent fictitious African nation of Guanaya, a man who “wore his black beard and his Negritude with enormous dignity,” Killens explains. Guanaya is probably not all that far from another fictitious African country, one made famous by Marvel. Like Wakanda, which has vibranium, Guanaya is home to a rare mineral known as cobanium, “the largest, richest bed of the best bloody cobanium in the entire world,” according to Guanaya’s minister of defense, Joseph Oladeli Babalumbi. The novel proper opens in the Executive Mansion in Guanaya, where Olivamaki’s cabinet is discussing an invitation from the U.S. government “to be their guest and see America” and “confer with their great and gracious president, who had the nicest, whitest smile in all the world and a face that made you know everything would be all right, somehow somewhere, and a warmth that made you feel like snuggling up.” Before they can depart, however, a plot is uncovered to overthrow the prime minister and install a new leader in Guanaya. The only solution is to enlist the help of Jimmy Jay, who was born in Lolliloppi, Miss., and who had fetched up in Bamakanougou, the capital of Guanaya, less than three months before, by accident. Someone noticed that Jimmy Jay, with a beard strapped on, was a dead ringer for the prime minister, so it is decided that half the cabinet, led by Jimmy Jay disguised as the prime minister, will head to America, while the other half, overseen by the real prime minister, will stay home and mind the store. Then it’s hey-ho and off we go to the airport for the long flight to Washington, D.C. Killens’s Africa is a caricature that might, in other circumstances, be irritating. But “The Minister Primarily” isn’t a book about Africa. It’s about America, and the author has a lot to say about his homeland, starting with “Jimmy Johnson’s Poop Sheet for Jungle Travel,” which the fake prime minister writes up the night before the Washington visit and hands out to the half-cabinet that will be traveling with him. In “The Land of the Thief and the home of the slave,” he writes (borrowing from W. E. B. Du Bois), white Americans are “citizens.” Black Americans are “subjects.” A white man who drives a Cadillac is “affluent,” a Black one is a “conspicuous consumer, uncouth, stupid, loud, etc., etc.” The moment they touch down in America, the dignitaries are greeted by a couple of bands playing “For He’s a Jolly Good Fellow,” and then they travel to the White House, where in the course of the evening, the president serves them whiskey, and then more whiskey, and says, “This is a social evening, Mr. Prime Meneceter, but I want you to know, we think of your fuh-fuh-fuh-fabulous country as the bulwark of democracy against godless communism.” He continues: “And with certain democratic provisional provisos and assurances and free world commitments, but with no strings attached, we are ready, willing and able to give all kinds of assistance, financial, educational, technical.” Then he clears his throat and explains, “And especially we are willing to help you get that cobanium out of the ground just as quick as we possibly can.” Along with the realpolitik, there is fun to be had. Once in New York, the Guanayans go up to Harlem and to Jamaica, Queens, before heading off (of course) to Lolliloppi, Miss., where Jimmy Jay and the Guanayans teach K.K.K. members more about brotherly love than they ever thought possible. Even more than telling a fine tale, Killens wants to see grown men transformed. Inspired by Southern hospitality (and a warning from the president in Washington that nothing must disturb the smooth development of Guanayan-American relations), the erstwhile white supremacists of Lolliloppi discover their hidden humanity. It’s as if the white Southerners the Guanayans encounter, led by their fake prime minister, are touched by a magic wand; as a result of the Africans’ visit, they begin speaking of Lolliloppi’s mayor as governor — and even as president. Killens has read his Shakespeare. With the surprises in its plot and its quadrilles of mistaken identities, “The Minister Primarily” is right up there with “The Tempest” and “The Comedy of Errors.” The choreography of his set pieces has an effulgent warmth that is as passionately expressed as it is disarming, creeping up on the reader with such skill you hardly realize you’re being stalked by a master. Killens’s writing about sex, of which there is a lot, both of the emotional tsunami kind and of the nothing-but-lust kind, should be used in creative writing courses across the country.

2021-08-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/19/business/japan-ghosn-escape-taylors-sentenced.html," TOKYO — A Japanese court on Monday sentenced two Americans to prison for their role in helping the former Nissan leader Carlos Ghosn skip bail and flee Japan. Michael Taylor, 60, was given a sentence of two years, and his son Peter Maxwell Taylor, 28, received one year and eight months. The men helped smuggle Mr. Ghosn onto a private jet and whisk him to Lebanon as he awaited trial in Japan on charges of financial wrongdoing. The men admitted their role in the escape during a court proceeding in Tokyo in June. In handing down the sentence, the judge said that their actions had caused “extreme damage” to the Japanese justice system and that time in prison was “unavoidable,” according to local news reports. Mr. Ghosn escaped Japan in 2019 just before New Year’s Day. He was out on bail after having been arrested multiple times and believed Japan’s justice system would never give him a fair trial. The Taylors helped him plan and execute an escape, part of which included being hidden in a box to be put on a flight first to Turkey and then to Beirut. The father and son returned to the United States, where the American authorities arrested them in the spring of 2020. After months of attempts to block extradition, they were handed over to Japan in March and put on trial three months later. In court last month, the Taylors expressed remorse for their role in the escape. Mr. Ghosn remains in Lebanon, where he has waged a campaign to rehabilitate his image and bring attention to what he has characterized as the failings of Japan’s justice system. He has said that he committed no wrongdoing and that the charges against him were the product of corporate intrigue backed by the Japanese government. Lebanon does not have an extradition treaty with Japan, effectively protecting Mr. Ghosn from sharing the Taylors’ fate. Another former Nissan executive, an American named Greg Kelly, is on trial in Japan on charges related to hiding Mr. Ghosn’s compensation. He says he is innocent.",8,2021,2021_q3
2021-08-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/15/business/india-mastercard-data.html," NEW DELHI — India on Wednesday barred Mastercard from adding new customers in the country over claims that it had violated the country’s data storage laws, a blow to the company in a market it was investing in heavily for expansion. The Reserve Bank of India said Mastercard had not complied with a 2018 order to store data on local transactions only in India despite “considerable time and adequate opportunities” to do so. The ban on issuing cards to new customers will go into effect on July 22, the central bank said in a statement. Mastercard said in a statement that it was “disappointed” by the government restriction, but the move would not affect its operations. It added that it had worked closely with the authorities to “ensure we comply with the requirements” of the 2018 directive. A company representative declined to elaborate on the bank’s decision. “Mastercard is fully committed to our legal and regulatory obligations in the markets we operate in,” the statement said. “We will continue to work with them and provide any additional details needed to resolve their concerns.” American Express and Diners Club also faced similar restrictions this spring, but they are significantly smaller players in the Indian market. Mastercard accounted for 33 percent of card payments in India, second only to Visa, which had a 45 percent share, according to a 2020 study by PPRO, a London-based payments start-up. In 2019, Mastercard announced that it was investing $1 billion over five years to expand its presence in India, adding to the $1 billion it had already invested from 2014 to 2019. As part of India’s push to better protect its data, the demand that end-to-end transaction details be stored only in India has caused complications for international payment processors. But India has resisted lobbying from the financial companies, which argued that the setting up of local data processing increased costs significantly and could set a precedent for other countries to do the same and potentially affect their fraud monitoring. “I don’t think it is a case of that they are saying that we will not do it — there might be some delay and they may be in the process of doing it,” A.P. Hota, an online payments analyst who formerly led India’s National Payment Corporation, said about the latest restriction on Mastercard. Mr. Hota said the top 50 banks in India have relationships with Mastercard, but also with Visa and Rupay, a local payment processor. Mastercard could control the damage if the ban was brief, but the blowback of extended restrictions could be harsh in a market in which Mastercard was investing heavily. “There will be a significant impact,” he said. “Banks who have arrangements with Mastercard in a big way will have to think about alternatives.”",8,2021,2021_q3
2021-08-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/02/business/stock-market-2021-first-half.html," Zoom and Peloton are out. Oil drillers and metal miners are in. Tech companies that made remote living possible — or even bearable — were the center of the action last year as investors sought companies that were either immune to the economic chaos of the pandemic or potential winners from the disruption caused by lockdowns. But now, money is flowing into old-fashioned sectors where profits are soaring because of the rebounding economy, which is growing at the fastest rate since the early 1980s. The “economic reawakening” has been a boon for certain companies, said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse. “And those tend to be, it’s very simple, old economy.” Through the first six months of the year, the S&P 500 was up 14.4 percent, led by the same energy and financial stocks that limped through last year’s economic collapse. That ranks as the second-best performance for the first half of a year since 1998, during the dot-com boom. On Wednesday, the last day of the second quarter, the S&P 500 inched up 0.1 percent and closed at a record high of 4,297.50. While the meme-stock mania that began in January was a very public display of investor sentiment, the more profound shift happened under the surface. The arrival of coronavirus vaccines toward the end of last year allowed investors to shift their focus to the companies that have long been considered sleepy counterparts to sexy tech shares, such as oil companies and metal makers whose fortunes were deeply uncertain at the start of the pandemic. “Whatever company was almost bankrupt but didn’t quite go bankrupt, those are the stocks that are going to do the best,” said Tony DeSpirito, chief investment officer of U.S. Fundamental Active Equity at BlackRock, explaining why some of the worst-performing stocks from last year are leading the pack in 2021. Shares of Marathon Oil tumbled 50 percent last year, as oil prices collapsed and even briefly dropped below zero. The company had to cut production and temporarily axed its dividend to conserve cash as the economy reeled and uncertainty prevailed. But oil is back above $70 a barrel, and Marathon’s shares have more than doubled this year, making it the biggest gainer in the S&P 500. Two other oil and gas drillers, Occidental Petroleum and Diamondback, are not far behind. A boom in other commodities is likewise lifting metal makers and miners to the top of the heap for investors. Shares of the steel maker Nucor were down 5.5 percent last year but are up 80 percent in 2021 as steel prices have hit record highs. Shares of the copper miner Freeport-McMoRan are up more than 42 percent as demand for that crucial industrial material has surged. And a broad variety of financial stocks are also flying high. Large banks on Wall Street notched record trading gains early in the year and are now increasing dividends that had to be put on hold during the worst of the Covid-19 crisis at a faster pace than expected. Shares of Goldman Sachs (up more than 40 percent) and Wells Fargo (up more than 50 percent) are also big winners. Shares of the credit card company Capital One Financial have done even better, rising 56.5 percent thanks to the surprisingly healthy state of consumer finances — defaults are lower than had been forecast. American Express, whose cards are frequently deployed by those traveling for business or pleasure, has been helped by the rebound in the tourism industry. Its stock is up almost 37 percent. On Wall Street, these kinds of companies are often described as cyclical — that is, they are closely tied to the rhythm of the economy, rising and falling as economic growth accelerates or slows. They’re often called “value” stocks because they’re relatively cheap, as opposed to “growth” stocks. And investors expect that the vaccine-enabled revival of the economy will provide a short-term lift to their profitability. At Franklin Templeton in San Mateo, Calif., Serena Perin Vinton, a portfolio manager, has been buying shares of one so-called value company, Estée Lauder, during the first half of the year. The company sells a surprising amount of its sculpting lipstick, stay-in-place foundation and skin care creams at airports. Ms. Perin Vinton is betting, in part, that the company’s sales will continue to recover as vaccinated travelers return to the skies and as people simply return to work and socialize face to face. “Now, it’s really like we only put on barely a little bit of makeup for a Zoom call,” Ms. Perin Vinton joked. She has also beefed up her holdings of other companies that are poised to ride the recovery, including the casino operator Las Vegas Sands and Airbnb, both of which should profit as the travel and leisure sector bounces back. At Goldman Sachs Asset Management, portfolio managers are still focused on tech stocks with long-term potential, but they are also looking for companies with close ties to the current business cycle, said Katie Koch, a global co-head of fundamental equity funds at the firm. “We don’t want to get run over by the cycle,” she said. The approach at Goldman means looking at cyclical stocks that also have the potential to capitalize on longer-term trends. Examples, Ms. Koch said, could include an aluminum can company, which could see an uptick in activity during the recovery while benefiting from a shift away from single-use plastic. Or a copper miner, which will be lifted not only by higher commodity prices linked to rising global demand but also by copper’s use in transitional technologies such as solar and wind power. Though some shares that were wildly popular last year have declined — Peloton is down 18.3 percent, and that’s an improvement from the aftermath of a recall of its treadmills — technology as a whole is by no means tumbling. Zoom Video Communications was up 14.7 percent in the first six months of this year, which looks meager only compared with a rise of almost 400 percent in 2020. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index was up 12.5 percent in the first half of the year, even if cyclical stocks were bigger gainers. The result is a broad rally that analysts expect to continue. Interest rates remain low, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note ended Wednesday at 1.45 percent. Economists think the economy will grow 6.5 percent this year, which would be the fastest rate since 1984, according to data from FactSet.  Of course, even with a strong economy and companies forecasting healthy profits, there are risks to the romp higher for the markets. The coronavirus remains an unpredictable threat, with highly contagious variants continuing to circulate. Some analysts worry about the potential for corporate and capital gains tax increases, which the Biden administration is considering. And if inflation becomes more than a temporary problem, the Federal Reserve could cut back on some of the supportive policies it has put in place. As recently as March, stocks wobbled over fears of high inflation. And even investors’ increasingly optimistic expectations can eventually cause the market to slow, said Ed Clissold, chief U.S. strategist at the stock market research firm Ned Davis. Their belief that there will continue to be robust economic growth and solid corporate profits informs stock prices, and eventually it might become more difficult for their outlook to get any more rosy. “We need to be aware that we’re approaching the point where a lot of the good news is priced in,” he said.",8,2021,2021_q3
2021-08-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/09/business/economy/g20-global-minimum-tax.html," VENICE — The world’s top economic leaders convened on Friday to hash out crucial details of what would be the largest overhaul of the international tax system in a century, kicking off a three-month race to finish a deal by the end of the year. Gathering in Venice, an ancient hub of international commerce, finance ministers from the Group of 20 nations are pressing ahead with plans to put an end to global tax havens and force multinational corporations to pay an appropriate share of tax wherever they operate. The negotiations, which could have sweeping ramifications for the finances of global businesses, have been sputtering along for much of the last decade and are entering what officials hope to be the final stretch. “A few big weeks and months are ahead,” said Pascal Saint-Amans, director of the center for tax policy and administration at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which is overseeing the talks, in a brief interview ahead of the summit. The meetings follow a breakthrough in the negotiations last week, when 130 countries backed a conceptual framework for the new tax plan. The blueprint includes a global minimum tax of at least 15 percent that each country would adopt and new rules that would force technology giants like Amazon and Facebook and other big global businesses to pay taxes in countries where their goods or services are sold, even if they have no physical presence there. On Friday, Peru, which did not initially join the O.E.C.D. agreement, signed on, a person familiar with the negotiations said, bringing the number to 131 countries backing the blueprint. The changes to the world’s tax system would generate an additional $150 billion of global tax revenue per year, the O.E.C.D. estimates, and shift taxing rights of over $100 billion in profits to different countries. Officials hope to complete a deal by October, when the leaders of the G20 countries return to Italy for the last summit of the year. The stakes to meet that deadline are high, particularly for the United States. President Biden has tied his proposal to raise the corporate tax rate in the United States to 28 percent from 21 percent to a global minimum tax, saying it would dissuade companies from simply moving operations offshore. The agreement is also intended to put an end to a cascade of digital services taxes that many countries around the world, including Britain, France and Italy, are adopting to capture more tax revenue from American technology companies. The United States has called those taxes discriminatory, and the Biden administration has approved retaliatory tariffs on wine, cheese, clothing and other products from those countries that could go into effect this year if a deal is not reached. The United States wants European countries to drop their digital services taxes immediately, but policymakers have suggested that they could remain in place until a new agreement is fully enacted, which could take years. The European Union is also pressing ahead with a new digital tax even as the O.E.C.D. talks proceed. Janet L. Yellen, the Treasury secretary, is expected to urge her European Union counterparts to delay such a move when she visits Belgium next week at the conclusion of her two-country trip. Policymakers must also agree on the exact rate that global companies would face. The United States and France would like the global tax to be higher than 15 percent. Bruno Le Maire, France’s finance minister, said on Friday that he would push for that amount as a minimum. “This must be a groundbreaking agreement,” Mr. Le Maire told reporters in Venice. “That is why France is going to advocate for a global minimum corporate tax of higher than 15 percent, because this is the first time we can really put an end to the race to the bottom on international taxation, which is clearly a dead end for all of us.” Mr. Le Maire did not specify what rate France would seek. The country has one of the highest standard corporate tax rates in Europe, at 33.5 percent, although the effective rate that companies pay is much lower. Raising the minimum tax above the Biden administration’s proposed 15 percent rate would allow the creation of “new funding for the fight against climate change,” Mr. Le Maire said. “So I’m confident that even if there are some different views among G20 member states we can reach an agreement.” He added that France would put “all our pressure, all of our impetus to get this breakthrough.” Yet some countries with low tax rates, like Ireland, have not agreed to sign on to the tax at all, which could undercut the overall effort to end tax havens. Policymakers say they are confident that Ireland and other holdouts will come along voluntarily. But the agreement does include measures to increase pressure on those countries. Its goal is to deprive those holdout nations of the tax revenue gained from lowering their rates to attract multinational companies — by reducing the tax advantages those companies enjoy from setting up their headquarters in tax havens. Mr. Biden has proposed such an enforcement measure as part of his tax plan to fund his $4 trillion economic agenda. It would effectively raise U.S. taxes on corporations that have headquarters in tax havens but do business in America, if their home countries have not signed on to the O.E.C.D. minimum tax or raised their corporate rates to meet the minimum. Under current law, companies with headquarters in low-tax countries can move some of their profits earned by subsidiaries in the United States and send them back to headquarters as payments for things like the use of intellectual property, then deduct those payments from their American income taxes. The Biden plan would disallow those deductions for companies based in low-tax countries. Like other parts of Mr. Biden’s plan, that provision will require congressional approval, which is not guaranteed. Business groups have mobilized to oppose all of Mr. Biden’s plans to raise taxes on corporations. Administration officials say that the provision, known as SHIELD, is a model for other countries, and that it would become more effective if adopted more broadly. If a critical mass of countries deny deductions to corporations with headquarters in low-tax countries, they say, those corporations will lose the benefits of their home location. This could prompt them to relocate, reducing revenues for the low-tax holdouts. Mr. Saint-Amans said he believed that reluctant countries such as Ireland would come around to join the agreement if the United States was able to pass the changes through Congress — something he acknowledged was not guaranteed. Republican lawmakers have expressed some skepticism about the global minimum tax, in part because they see it as a stalking horse for the Biden administration to raise the U.S. corporate tax rate. Treasury officials have expressed confidence that the global tax can pass muster in the United States. But officials have not made clear whether the White House believes it needs to gain the support of reluctant Republicans or if it can push the tax changes through Congress only with votes from Democrats. Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the top Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, told reporters this week that he believed the Biden administration’s proposed tax overhaul would be dead on arrival in Congress. “I think first, this is an economic surrender that other countries are glad to go along with, as long as America is making itself that uncompetitive,” Mr. Brady said. “And secondly, I think there are too many competing interests here for them to finalize a deal that would be agreeable to Congress.” Other nations must also determine how to turn their commitments into domestic law. The mechanics of changing how the largest and most profitable companies are taxed, and of making exceptions for financial services, oil and gas businesses, will be central to the discussions. There are already concerns that carve-outs could lead to new tax loopholes. Ms. Yellen, who is making her second international trip as Treasury secretary, will be holding bilateral meetings with many of her counterparts, including officials from Saudi Arabia, Japan, Turkey and Argentina. China, which signed on to the global minimum tax framework, is not expected to send officials to the gathering of finance ministers and central bank governors, so there will be no discussions between the world’s two largest economic powers. Mr. Saint-Amans expressed optimism about the trajectory of the tax negotiations, which were on life support during the final year of the Trump administration, and attributed that largely to the new diplomatic approach from the United States. “It took a U.S. election, and some work at the O.E.C.D.,” he said. During the panel discussion on tax and climate change, Ms. Yellen’s counterparts said they appreciated the spirit of cooperation from the United States. Chrystia Freeland, Canada’s deputy prime minister and finance minister, said having the United States back at the table working to combat climate change was “welcome” and “transformative.” Mr. Le Maire thanked the Biden administration for rejoining the Paris Agreement. “The U.S. is back,” he said.

2021-08-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/03/business/dealbook/hacking-wall-street.html," The DealBook newsletter delves into a single topic or theme every weekend, providing reporting and analysis that offers a better understanding of an important issue in the news. If you don’t already receive the daily newsletter, sign up here. At a Congressional hearing in May, the chief executives of Wall Street’s six largest banks were asked to name the greatest threat to their companies and the wider financial system. They did not mention the global pandemic, climate change or factors that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis. The most popular answer instead was “cybersecurity.” Bank executives, security experts and federal officials have been planning for potentially devastating cyberattacks against the financial industry for at least a decade. But the issue has grown more urgent in recent years because of an increase in nation-state cyberattacks against critical infrastructure, such as the cyberattacks by Russia that took out part of Ukraine’s electric grid and the WannaCry worm linked to North Korea that hit the hospital and shipping industries. The Federal Reserve Chairman, Jerome Powell, recently told “60 Minutes” that “the risk that we keep our eyes on the most now is cyber risk.” The federal government and financial institutions have formed information-sharing groups, performed tabletop exercises and invested heavily in cybersecurity. JPMorgan Chase alone spends about $600 million each year on cybersecurity efforts and has “more than 3,000 employees” working on the issue in some way. Still, experts say there are significant gaps in awareness and preparation for a cyberattack on Wall Street, and that the focus has more often been on threats to individual institutions than on threats to the system as a whole. The recent spate of ransomware attacks underscored the vulnerability of individual companies’ systems. “I think everybody believes an institution can be taken out,” said Greg Rattray, the former director of cybersecurity at the National Security Council and a former chief information security officer for JPMorgan. But, he said, “the degree of risk, I think, is really not well understood systemically.” Key financial institutions rehearse responses to cyberattack scenarios. But Mr. Rattray said these exercises provide more confidence in readiness than they should. Unlike the detailed simulations that help prepare first responders and soldiers for hurricanes, forest fires and wars, “we do not simulate the scale of destruction, and we never simulate duration” with cyberattacks, Mr. Rattray said. “What we don’t know is how bad it would get and how fast.” The financial system could probably withstand one large institution getting knocked out, but if multiple large financial institutions were shut down by a cyberattack, the disruption could last for weeks, he said. Additionally, if attackers struck during a particularly volatile period in the markets — for example, on one of the “triple witching” Fridays that occur each quarter when stock options, stock index futures and stock index options all expire on the same day — the effects could be amplified. Such an attack would require skill, resources and immense coordination, which so far adversaries have not shown. Most cyberattacks against financial institutions to date have involved criminal theft of bank card numbers and account credentials; although a few incidents involving nation-backed actors have occurred, they’ve been contained in scope and impact. In late 2011, Iranian hackers associated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps launched a monthslong denial-of-service campaign against dozens of U.S. financial institutions, including American Express, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, according to Justice Department documents. The onslaught disabled banking websites and locked hundreds of thousands of customers out of online accounts. And in 2016, hackers associated with North Korea broke into Bangladesh Bank and hijacked employee credentials in an attempt to steal $951 million via the Swift network, a messaging system used by financial institutions. They succeeded in nabbing $81 million. More sophisticated and destructive attacks are not out of the question, however. The New York Cyber Task Force — a group of government and private industry experts convened by Columbia University and led by Mr. Rattray — examined a “severe but plausible” scenario involving multiple financial institutions. In the theoretical scenario, described in a report the task force published this year, North Korean hackers compromise a third-party service provider, such as a cloud computing company, to slip into a financial institution’s network and install a self-propagating digital worm that wipes data. As other financial institutions communicate with the infected bank, the wiper spreads to their networks as well. The scenario highlights how swiftly an attack could cascade and how financial institutions that are focused on securing their own networks from adversaries could miss the risk of being compromised by the network of trusted partners. If this scenario were to occur as the task force imagined, an initiative called Sheltered Harbor would help address at least the loss of data. The program, launched by the industry in 2015, is designed to protect banks from losing valuable data because of cyberattacks — the data of participating banks is encrypted and backed up daily to offline secure storage so that if it gets deleted or altered, or access to it is blocked, it can be restored. Under a 2013 White House executive order, the Department of Homeland Security was asked to identify critical infrastructures for which a cybersecurity incident could have “catastrophic regional or national effects on public health or safety, economic security or national security.” Within the financial sector, D.H.S. and the Treasury Department identified more than two dozen key financial institutions that fit the description, according to sources who asked not to be named because the information is sensitive. Not long after the list was created, eight of the top U.S. financial institutions formed the Financial Systemic Analysis & Resilience Center to address cyberattack risks. The eight were Bank of America, BNY Mellon, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, State Street and Wells Fargo. But banks aren’t necessarily the biggest risk to the system as a whole. Many critical infrastructure industries are composed of interwoven entities that make cybersecurity tricky — a hit on one key institution puts all others potentially at risk. The financial sector is more interwoven than most and relies on a few major institutions that if taken out can bring critical services and processes for the entire industry to a halt. These include payment card processors, clearing houses like ACH and Fedwire, and systems for settling transactions involving bonds, equities and options — for example, the National Securities Clearing Corporation and the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation. Financial entities aren’t the only concern; nonfinancial third-party providers, such as cloud services companies, electric utilities and data storage services could have great impact on financial services if wiped out. “There is little understanding of the ways in which the failure, whether by accident or adversary design, of an IT company ‘too big to fail’ (such as a major cloud service provider) might cascade,” wrote the authors of a Brookings study on financial stability and cyber risk. Eric Goldstein, the executive assistant director for cybersecurity at D.H.S.’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, wouldn’t quantify how prepared the financial industry is. He said his agency is helping to ensure that all organizations — not just the financial sector — implement the right security controls and resiliency measures so that businesses can continue to operate even in the face of an attack. Experts say individual financial institutions are resilient enough to withstand attacks as well as deposit runs that likely would result. Darrell Duffie, a professor at Stanford’s business school, examined the potential impact of a “cyber run” in a paper published with Joshua Younger, a managing director at JPMorgan. Banks are required to have 30-day liquidity — the ability to access within 30 days funds to cover every deposit and line of credit should all customers withdraw holdings or face called-in debts. Among a sampling of the 12 top U.S. financial institutions, the authors concluded all had sufficient liquid assets to cover a “relatively extreme” cyber run, as well as access to additional funds from the Federal Reserve. But resilience against a cyber run doesn’t preclude damage to the economy, Mr. Duffie and Mr. Younger noted. Financial markets, probably more than any other critical infrastructure except elections, require public trust to operate. This can quickly erode, even if an attack isn’t widespread. Corporate customers and financial firms that aren’t directly affected by an attack but need access to large sums of money on short notice could decide to withdraw money from banks anyway, to place it where they’re assured fast access. Or they could stop processing payments out of caution. Furthermore, if a major processing or settlement house were taken out, the instability “would be very devastating for the performance of financial markets,” Mr. Duffie told DealBook. “To the extent that trades continue to occur and are not settled, investors would get extremely nervous,” Mr. Duffie said, adding that if the uncertainty persists for days, prices could decline “very rapidly and significantly,.” Mr. Goldstein of the D.H.S. said that companies need to plan a strategy to communicate clearly to the public the potential implications of a cybersecurity incident, and to deliver it quickly. “The last thing that any organization wants to occur is to have a misinterpretation or even misinformation about the incident cause consumers or customers or suppliers to take action” that could escalate the problem, he said.

2021-08-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/10/us/politics/global-tax-overhaul-g20.html," VENICE — Global leaders on Saturday agreed to move ahead with what would be the most significant overhaul of the international tax system in decades, with finance ministers from the world’s 20 largest economies backing a proposal that would crack down on tax havens and impose new levies on large, profitable multinational companies. If enacted, the plan could reshape the global economy, altering where corporations choose to operate, who gets to tax them and the incentives that nations offer to lure investment. But major details remain to be worked out ahead of an October deadline to finalize the agreement and resistance is mounting from businesses, which could soon face higher tax bills, as well as from small, but pivotal, low-tax countries such as Ireland, which would see their economic models turned upside down. After spending the weekend huddled in the halls of an ancient Venetian naval shipyard, the top economic officials from the Group of 20 nations agreed to forge ahead. They formally threw their support behind a proposal for a global minimum tax of at least 15 percent that each country would adopt and new rules that would require large global businesses, including technology giants like Amazon and Facebook, to pay taxes in countries where their goods or services are sold, even if they have no physical presence there. “After many years of discussions and building on the progress made last year, we have achieved a historic agreement on a more stable and fairer international tax architecture,” the finance ministers said in a joint statement, or communiqué, at the conclusion of the meetings. The approach marks a reversal of years of economic policies that embraced low taxes as a way for countries to attract investment and fuel growth. Instead, countries are coalescing around the view that they must fund infrastructure, public goods and prepare for future pandemics with more fiscal firepower at their disposal, prompting a global hunt for revenue. “I see this deal as being something that’s good for all of us, because as everyone knows, for decades now, the world community, including the United States, we’ve been participating in this self-defeating international tax competition,” Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said on the sidelines of the G20 summit. “I’m really hopeful that with the growing consensus that we’re on a path to a tax regime that will be fair for all of our citizens.” The agreement followed a joint statement last week that was signed by 130 countries who expressed support for a conceptual framework that has been the subject of negotiations at the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development for the better part of the last decade. The O.E.C.D. estimates that the proposal would raise an additional $150 billion of global tax revenue per year and move taxing rights of over $100 billion in profits to different countries. The backing of the broad framework by the finance ministers on Saturday represented a critical step forward, but officials acknowledged that the hardest part lies ahead as they try to finalize an agreement by the time the leaders of the Group of 20 nations meet in Rome in October. Among the biggest hurdles is an ongoing reluctance by low-tax jurisdictions like Ireland, Hungary and Estonia, which have refused to sign on to the pact, potentially dooming the type of overhaul that Ms. Yellen and others envision. Hungary and Estonia have raised concerns that joining the agreement might violate European Union law and Ireland, which has a tax rate of 12.5 percent, fears that it will upend its economic model, siphoning the foreign investment that has powered its economy. Absent unanimous approval among the members of the European Union, an accord would stall. Establishing a minimum tax would require an E.U. directive, and directives require backing by all 28 countries in the union. Ireland had previously hinted that they would object to or block a directive and Hungary could prove to be an even bigger hurdle given its fraught relationship with the union, which has pressed Hungary on unrelated rule-of-law and corruption issues. Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary has stated that taxes are a sovereign issue and recently called a proposed global minimum corporate tax “absurd.” Hungary’s low corporate rate of 9 percent has helped it lure major European manufacturers, especially German carmakers including Mercedes and Audi. Bruno Le Maire, France’s finance minister, said on Saturday that it was important that all of Europe supports the proposal. G20 countries plan to meet with Ireland, Hungary and Estonia next week to try and address their concerns, he said. “We will discuss the point next week with the three countries that still have some doubts,” he said. “I really think the impetus given by the G20 countries is clearly a decisive one and that this breakthrough should gather all European nations together.” Policymakers also have yet to determine the exact rate that companies will pay, with the United States and France pushing to go above 15 percent, and negotiations are continuing over which firms will be subject to the tax and who will be excluded. The framework currently exempts financial services firms and extractive industries such as oil and gas, a carve-out that tax experts have suggested could open a big loophole as companies try to redefine themselves to meet the requirements for exemptions. Domestic politics could also pose hurdles for the countries that have agreed to join but need to turn that commitment into law, including in the United States, where Republican lawmakers have signaled their disapproval, saying the plan would hurt American firms. Big business interests are also warily eyeing the pact and suggesting they plan to fight anything that puts American companies at a disadvantage. “The most important thing is understanding that if there is going to be an agreement, that there cannot be an agreement that is punitive toward U.S. companies,” said Neil Bradley, the chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “And that, of course, is of great concern.” A report this month from the European Network for Economic and Fiscal Policy Research found that only 78 companies are expected to be affected by the overhaul but nearly two-thirds of them are American. The researchers estimated that the new taxes would raise $87 billion in revenue and that Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Intel, and Facebook would pay $28 billion of that total. At the heart of the proposal is the idea that, if countries all agree to a minimum tax, it will prevent businesses from seeking out low-tax jurisdictions for their headquarters, depriving their home countries of revenue. Ms. Yellen has criticized what she calls a “race to the bottom” in global taxation. Ms. Yellen said that she would be working in the coming months to address the concerns of countries with reservations but that the deal could still proceed even if some countries did not join. She pointed to an enforcement mechanism that would raise U.S. taxes on corporations that have headquarters in countries that continue to be tax havens but do business in America. Still, changing domestic tax laws will not be quick or easy, including in the United States, whose success in ushering in a new tax regime is being closely watched as a harbinger of whether a global overhaul can come to pass. Senior officials at the G20 meetings said that approval of the agreement within the United States was crucial to its broader acceptance. Republican lawmakers have suggested they will put up a fight. Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee and one of the architects of the 2017 tax cuts, said that the Biden administration’s tax proposals would never pass. “Certainly in Congress there’s a great deal of skepticism,” Mr. Brady said in a telephone interview this week. “My prediction is that at the end of the day, even if an agreement is reached, what the president will bring back to Congress is an agreement that advantages foreign companies and workers over American ones.” Ms. Yellen indicated that Democrats were prepared to pass as many of the tax changes as they can through a budgetary procedure called reconciliation that would alleviate the need for Republican votes. She assured her international counterparts that the Biden administration was ready to deliver its end of the bargain and pushed back against the idea that the new tax system would harm American workers. “For the United States, it’s going to be a fundamental shift in how we choose to compete in the world economy,” Ms. Yellen said. “Not a competition based on rock-bottom tax rates, but rather on the skills of our work force, our ability to innovate and our fundamental talents.” Policymakers continue to grapple with what the global minimum tax rate will be and what exactly will be subject to the tax. A separate proposal calls for an additional tax on the largest and most profitable multinational enterprises, those with profit margins of at least 10 percent. Officials want to apply that tax to at least 20 percent of profit exceeding that 10 percent margin for those companies, but continue to debate how the proceeds would be divided among countries around the world. Developing economies are pushing to ensure that they will get their fair share. Mr. Bradley, of the Chamber, said that the details of a final agreement would determine how punitive it would be for companies. Representatives from Google and Facebook have been in touch with senior Treasury officials as the process has played out. American businesses are also worried about being put at a disadvantage by a 21 percent tax that President Biden has proposed on their overseas profits, if their foreign competitors are only paying 15 percent. The Biden administration also wants to raise the domestic corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 28 percent. Democrats in Congress are moving forward with legislation to make those changes to the tax code this year. “If a U.S. company is trying to compete globally with a significantly higher tax burden because of this significantly higher minimum tax on its operations, that’s a competitive issue for being able to be successful,” said Barbara Angus, a global tax policy leader at Ernst & Young. Washington and Europe also remain at odds over how to tax digital giants like Google and Amazon.  At the G20 summit, finance ministers expressed optimism that such obstacles could be overcome. In his closing news conference after the deal was reached, Daniele Franco, Italy’s finance minister, hailed the agreement as historic and called on the countries that had yet to join to reconsider. “To accept global rules is, for each country, difficult. Each country has to be prepared to compromise,” Mr. Franco said. “To have worldwide rules for taxing multinationals, for taxing the profits of big companies is a major change, is a major achievement.” Liz Alderman contributed reporting from Paris, and Eshe Nelson from London.",8,2021,2021_q3
2021-09-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/31/opinion/government-corruption.html," Today’s column was inspired by the latest twist in our still shambolic response to Covid — the continuing refusal of many Americans to get vaccinated and the insistence of some of them on swallowing horse paste instead. I tried to link this horrifying, if comic, development to the long relationship between right-wing extremism and patent medicine. But I didn’t have space to put this in the broader context of how money influences politics and policy. The simple fact is that none of us are saints. Even those who claim to be working for the common good can be and often are influenced by the prospect of personal reward. As conservative economists like to say, incentives matter. Indeed, it’s usually conservative economists who make this point most strongly. Half a century ago George Stigler of the University of Chicago published a hugely influential paper titled “The theory of economic regulation,” which argued that government regulators — like the boards setting rules for electricity generation and pricing — weren’t like the wise, selfless guardians of Plato’s “Republic”; they were human and hence subject to influence, which in practice meant that regulators were often captured by the very industries they were supposed to regulate. It was a good point, if perhaps too extreme — regulators may not be saints, but they aren’t always purely creatures of self-interest either. But it was too narrowly applied. Stigler’s followers have used his logic to make the case against regulation, arguing that regulators will be corrupted by special interests. But why restrict that insight to government officials? In particular, why not apply it to their own political movement? After all, surely the same logic that applies to regulators also applies to politicians and pundits, including those on the right who denounce regulation. And for that matter, it applies to intellectuals too, especially in those situations where the possible rewards for expressing the “right” opinions go beyond prestige and promotion into the realm of cold, hard cash. And as far back as I can remember, the world of conservative opinion and thought has, in fact, consisted largely of bought men and women. (I’ll talk about liberals in a minute.) I don’t think it was always thus. I’m not a huge fan of Milton Friedman’s legacy, but I do believe that he — and for that matter, Stigler — said what they did out of genuine, unforced conviction. Things have, however, changed since their heyday. In fact, they’ve changed twice. First came the rise of “movement conservatism” — a highly organized set of interlocking institutions, all backed by billionaires and big corporations, of which the Republican Party was only one piece. There were also media organizations, especially Fox, think tanks like the Heritage Foundation and more. By the aughts (we never did come up with a better name for this century’s first decade), these institutions had created a safe space, a guarantee of a stable and fairly lucrative career, for people willing to say the right things — tax cuts good, regulation bad — and not rock the boat. I never thought I’d be nostalgic for the era when big money ruled the right. But traditional corporate influence looks benign compared with where we are now. At this point, to be a conservative in good standing you have to pledge allegiance to blatant lies — Democrats are Marxists, the election was stolen, basic public health measures are sinister assaults on freedom. Why are so many people who have to know better willing to go along with these lies? Again, self-interest — partly ambition, and yes, partly financial reward. Obviously the snake-oil industry doesn’t have anything like the resources of more respectable Republican-leaning industries like fossil fuels or tobacco. But it offers more opportunities for personal enrichment: Ben Shapiro is presumably well paid for hawking “superfoods” in a way he couldn’t be for, say, promoting oil wells. OK, what about liberals? They’re people too, with all the usual human flaws; there are plenty of prominent liberals who I know personally to be driven by ego and to some extent by monetary considerations, people like … actually, not going there. But they live in a different environment from conservatives. The old Will Rogers line — “I am not a member of any organized political party — I am a Democrat” — still applies. Political science research confirms that the Republican Party, and conservatism in general, is an ideological monolith, albeit one largely under new management. Democrats and the center-left in general, by contrast, are a loose coalition, and to prosper in that coalition you have to satisfy multiple constituencies. This makes it harder to sell your soul, because it’s not clear who you’re supposed to sell it to. In the subculture I know best, politically active economists, those on the left, no matter how passionate they are about their politics — and no matter how self-centered — feel the need to retain academic credibility and, for those who do consulting, credibility with serious business interests. (See, I told you nobody is a saint.) Many of my economist friends look very favorably on President Biden’s policies, but they wouldn’t risk their reputations by claiming that Biden has Nobel-quality economic insight — or selling nutritional supplements. So the blend of craziness and corruption taking place on the American right is special, without anything comparable on the left. Don’t both-sides this. An oil field in the placenta. According to Rand Paul, scientists advising against horse paste just hate Trump. Conservative scholarship at work. But evolution is finally winning the argument. Hoping that New Orleans comes back soon. ",9,2021,2021_q3
2021-09-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/20/t-magazine/black-artists-expatriates.html," WHEN THE VISUAL artist Ellen Gallagher was 20, she sailed on an oceanography expedition from her home in New England to Martinique. It was 1986, and students in the former French colony were agitating for the right to take qualifying exams to attend university in France. To the sea-weary Gallagher, their protest looked more like a celebration. But she also felt, in this nexus of “Europe and Africa in the Americas,” she says, the “whimsical cruelty” of the imperial powers that had sought to carve up the globe, imposing vast cultural distance between places — predominantly white, Anglophone New England and Black, Francophone Martinique — that were so close you could readily sail between them. She moved to Rotterdam in the Netherlands, as if to defy and suture those borders, in 2001. By then, the now-55-year-old artist had become known for sorting clusters of googly eyes and thick lips into minimalist grids; paintings that slyly located the roots of Western abstraction in minstrel caricature. Gallagher’s move “off the grid” of New York (and into a port city reminiscent of her hometown, Providence, R.I.), while partly motivated by her Dutch partner and collaborator, the 58-year-old filmmaker Edgar Cleijne, seemed to plunge her deeper into the history of racial abstraction, extraction and myth. The “Watery Ecstatic” series she began shortly after her move depicted a surreal marine kingdom populated by enslaved West African women and their unborn children who jumped or were thrown overboard during the Middle Passage to the United States. The figures’ bulging eyes and distorted features suggested that minstrel physiognomy was inescapable even for those Black subjects who were not born into the New World. But there was a painful wit in Gallagher’s refusal to imagine the underwater children as exempt from this history of figuration: In these works of watercolor, oil, ink and cut paper on paper, colorful Black bodies tunnel through the veins of sea creatures, jump out of the water and fill fish bodies with eyeball-shaped cells. Here, the foundational homelessness produced by the slave trade emboldens a reimagining of what and where home can be, and who else might be there. “STEAL AWAY,” goes the traditional slave spiritual, a song that enshrouds a call to escape the plantation with an appeal to the afterlife; and Black Americans have responded to the original theft of the slave trade by stealing themselves back and away from the United States in myriad ways — to places beyond America, and to autonomous worlds within it that are defined by region and family rather than the nation-state. In the antebellum period, enslaved people who escaped joined Indigenous people to form secret maroon colonies in North and South America and the Caribbean, and white supremacist agencies found some free Blacks eager to join the cause to repatriate them to Africa. When Reconstruction policies aimed at social reform sparked violent backlashes and an increase in lynchings, thousands of Black Americans left for Liberia, a free nation with an elected Black government. Decades later, the Jamaican-born leader Marcus Garvey claimed to have inspired millions of adherents to his Universal Negro Improvement Association, a global benevolent association with its own dreams of African return. And throughout the 20th century, Black American artists and intellectuals including the sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois, the performers Paul Robeson and Nina Simone, the visual artists Augusta Savage and Romare Bearden and the writers Jessie Fauset, Richard Wright and James Baldwin traveled to Europe, the Caribbean and Africa seeking political alliances, creative opportunities and personal safety and sanity. Even when, in the 1960s, leaders like Malcolm X reconceived racial separatism in domestic rather than international terms — demanding that the U.S. government cede some states to Black citizens as reparations — activists like Amiri Baraka and Angela Davis sought refuge and revolutionary education in Fidel Castro’s Cuba, while writers like Julian Mayfield and Maya Angelou moved to newly independent Ghana. Many Black Americans have subsequently made new lives abroad for personal, creative and political reasons: the conceptual artist Adrian Piper in Berlin; the writer Andrea Lee in Torino, Italy; Tina Turner in Zurich; Yasiin Bey (formerly Mos Def) in South Africa, among others. Earlier this year, Stevie Wonder announced his plans to move to Ghana, where the tourism ministry recently ramped up its decades-long outreach efforts to Black Americans by hosting a Year of Return in 2019. Still, the decision to leave, like the decision to stay, has always been fraught. Was Africa a recoverable motherland, or had the Middle Passage marked an irreversible break (a concept examined by the scholar Saidiya Hartman in her 2007 book, “Lose Your Mother,” and underscored by the name of Ghana’s point of departure for the enslaved: the Door of No Return)? Was it better to fight racism at home or leave without trying to integrate into what Martin Luther King Jr. called “a burning house”? To risk malaria in Liberia or lynching in Missouri? More frivolously, should one believe the hype about Paris? Langston Hughes didn’t think so. “Style, class?” he wrote to Countee Cullen, another poet, in 1924. “You see more well-dressed people in a New York subway station in five seconds than I’ve seen all my three weeks in Paris.” “Stay home!” he advised another friend. This was not an option for artists such as Baker, Baldwin and Simone, who saw escaping the racial terrorism of what Simone called “the United Snakes of America” as the only way they could survive. Baldwin frequently cited a breaking point at which he felt he would kill, or be killed by, the next white American who called him the N-word. White American artists have also left, of course — think Gertrude Stein and F. Scott Fitzgerald moving to Paris in the early 20th century — but with less urgency and more faith in their capacity to enjoy the “movable feast” (to borrow the expat Ernest Hemingway’s term) of white privilege anywhere in the world. Black artists, on the other hand, have often had to leave the States in order to activate the power of mobility denied them at home: A U.S. passport grants Black citizens access to most other countries, whereas merely jogging and driving while Black can prove fatal in America. This contradiction fuels the contemporary trend known as Blaxit, a term named after the United Kingdom’s 2016 Brexit vote and attributed to the American human rights consultant Ulysses Burley III, who used it to describe the Black desire to escape both Donald Trump’s administration and ongoing police violence against Black people. Like earlier exoduses, Blaxit is driven by Black visions of “imaginary homelands,” as Salman Rushdie called them, but it also relies on individual capital and emphasizes personal fulfillment. The Blaxit Global Podcast, hosted by the 47-year-old New Jersey-based digital marketing entrepreneur Chrishan Wright (who also runs a related blog) begins with a seductive appeal: “Close your eyes and imagine living a life you love ... free from daily microaggressions from Karens and Kens, free from the fear of police brutality and systemic racism. Wouldn’t that feel amazing?” Many people report that it in fact does — even as Blaxit discourse, driven as it is by corporate interest, as well as a desperate optimism about Black prospects abroad, tends to mute the racism and other forms of oppression that mark life beyond the States. For all its complexities, Blaxit is perhaps most significant as a reminder that Black Americans (that is, those with the financial means to travel, who are not imprisoned or otherwise constrained by life in the United States) aren’t trapped. This message, so crucial in the midst of our current racial crisis, explains why even those African American writers who have stayed in the States have recently paid homage to iconic figures who’ve left. Earlier this spring, the Los Angeles-based poet and essayist Harmony Holiday, writing on Lit Hub, conjured the sacred Black space that Baldwin, Baker and the scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. created during a dinner in the South of France in 1973; Hanif Abdurraqib, who lives in Columbus, Ohio, writes in his 2021 book, “A Little Devil in America,” that he envies Baker (to whom he dedicates the book) because she “left America before it could persuade her to fall in love with it.” FOR A CURRENT generation of African American artists, the decision to leave is often a love story, although it is less about breaking permanently with the States than about pursuing romantic or creative prospects abroad. (Gallagher embodies both impulses.) Black creative relocation is as temporary or as permanent as love itself; one figures it out as one goes. While contemporary Black expats do not enter ready-made communities akin to the so-called Negro colony formed by Black expats in Paris between the world wars, or the 1960s writers’ community in Accra, Ghana, they often work closely with contemporaries in their chosen sites — an aspect of life abroad that Blaxit publicity, with its neocolonialist treatment of the adopted home as a blank slate of individual betterment, tends to forget. Their moves are at once personal and driven by a desire to connect; and if these artists do not expect to feel wholly at home anywhere in the world, neither do they assume America is the only, or the best, place to exercise their collaborative gifts. Stefanie Batten Bland, a 46-year-old choreographer raised in an artists’ community in downtown New York, was dancing with the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company in the early 2000s when she left the States to perform with Pina Bausch’s company in Germany. Bland, who identifies as an artist of “European and African descent” (her mother is a white science writer; her father was the Black jazz composer Edward Bland), had no illusions about finding greater racial acceptance in Europe; but she had been raised to “go where you are valued” as an artist. Aside from the limited professional options for dancers of color, Bland’s theater-dance sensibility seemed better suited to European traditions than to the non-narrative postmodernism then ascendant in the States. After Bausch, she danced with Pal Frenak in Hungary and France; later, having followed a lover to Paris, she auditioned for the role of Josephine Baker in the biographical musical produced by the Opéra Comique. The director Jérôme Savary hired her, not as “Jo” but as the head choreographer, and soon encouraged her to create her own shows. She founded her own company, SBB, in 2008. But after austerity measures cut public arts funding in Europe, where mentorship models were also lacking, she moved back to New York in 2011. She returns to France regularly (her partner is French), and retains a European dance corps in addition to an American one. Bland delights in describing the cross-cultural interplay between her U.S. and European teams, where the Americans bring hustle and fire — products of a system in which, for instance, a small, independent company can compete with New York’s Lincoln Center for the same source of funding — while the Europeans revel in process, research and detail. Sketching a common scene, she tells me how the Americans are impatient to make headway on a project, whereas “my European team might be like, ‘Well, why don’t we just think about this a little more? Is it even worth it?’ And then we start eating.” Around the time Gallagher and Bland were moving abroad, Mike Ladd, a poet and rapper from Boston known for mixing abrasive punk with Bollywood samples and discordant jazz, left the Bronx for Paris. He had fallen in love with a Parisian (now his wife, Fanny Ladd), but he left behind a vital musical community in New York, including the rapper El-P and the guitarist and drummer Jaleel Bunton. He did not expect Paris to benefit his art. On the contrary, as a student of global history (his undergraduate thesis focused on 19th-century Black American travel writers like William Wells Brown and Nancy Gardner Prince), Ladd felt that the lights had dimmed on the Paris that had allowed earlier Black artists to shine; those energies, he believed, had shifted to cities like Lagos, São Paulo and Mumbai. The first record he made while abroad (his seventh overall), “Negrophilia: The Album” (2005), is a complex homage to the historian Petrine Archer-Straw’s account of Black modernists in France. But Paris did eventually foster Ladd’s genius for collaboration. Now 51, he has worked with artists like the French rapper Casey and the legendary American jazz saxophonist (and fellow expat) Archie Shepp. Still, for years he toured so often that he imagined himself not a resident of Paris but an occupant of an “invented megalopolis” that included New York and London (Ladd’s friend and longtime collaborator, the pianist Vijay Iyer, has called it the “Atlantic Rim”). Plus, he “had little reverence for European culture.” This posture was liberating: He felt freer to experiment in front of audiences whose opinion he didn’t value. “The downside,” he says, is that in the absence of “my people, Black people, who are the toughest audience in the world, my craft wasn’t necessarily honed.” Now, when he performs for members of that original scene, he sometimes questions his work: “Is it excellent?” That concept, close cousin to the hustle that Bland describes, encompasses both a performance standard and a constant source of pressure that defined Ladd’s musical community at home. But he has learned to combine the possibilities of exilic experimentation with the rigor of that training ground. He cites one especially memorable gig with the Parisian Afrobeat band Arat Kilo and the Malian singer Mamani Keita, held at Maison la Grand Cour Desbassayns, a former slave plantation on the island of Réunion. “We decided we would do some spiritual housecleaning onstage that night,” he says. “We didn’t need to burn sage. We just performed with the type of vigor, bravery and generosity that bad spirits can’t handle.” SOME ARTISTS FIND peace and power in the state of transience. Brian Keith Jackson, a writer who grew up in Louisiana and now, at age 53, identifies as a “vagabond,” was living in New York when, in the wake of the 2008 financial collapse, he felt the city’s energy change. He had published three works of fiction, including a vibrant 2002 novel of manners and masquerade, “The Queen of Harlem,” but, he says, “I didn’t feel good.” He left for Beijing, where he had visited once before, in 2007, when he and the artist Mickalene Thomas had gone to visit Jackson’s friend the painter and fellow wanderer Kehinde Wiley. Jackson stayed in China for five years, then moved on to Tunisia and, over the years, frequently visited Dakar, Senegal, drawn by the water and by Wiley, who established an artist’s colony, Black Rock Senegal, there in 2019. Jackson returned to Dakar in February of 2020 for what he thought would be another short visit, but ended up staying, through the Covid-19 lockdown, for over a year — not only in Dakar, but inside. When we spoke in May, he estimated he had left his house 15 times. It was unnerving not to have a doctor or a hospital in the midst of a pandemic, yet empowering to be in a Black country. “We all talk about, ‘Oh, representation matters,’ like in the newsroom and on television,” he says, “but it’s still minuscule compared to being completely surrounded by people who look like you.” They aren’t all good or bad, of course, but the experience of living among them is restorative: “I think people need that,” he says. The need for Black community is no less pressing in majority-white spaces. Gallagher notes that Rotterdam is unique among European cities, in that people of color live in the center. That’s where “everybody wants to be,” she says, “like in New York.” (She keeps a second home in Brooklyn.) Ladd likewise began to feel at ease in Paris when he found areas that resembled New York: He rented a recording studio in the banlieue of St. Denis, which is like “the Bronx or Brooklyn of Paris,” he says, because “you’re surrounded by people of color.” It’s not that he feels politically safer in France. “We keep a jump bag,” he says, in case French nationalists gain more power and his family needs to leave. But he does feel more physically secure. He was walking down his street one day shortly after his move when it dawned on him: “There are no guns here — and 35 years of subconscious pressure just shot right out of my body.” To some extent, the U.S. passport gives African American artists not only mobility but also protection from the abuses sustained by people of color elsewhere in the world. In the 1950s, Baldwin felt his Americanness acutely when he saw how brutally Algerians were treated in France; their struggle for independence from French colonial rule was not his war, and his nationality partially exempted him from its consequences. For all that has changed in the decades since, Americans of all ethnicities are still often seen as the agents of empire, and their reputation for arrogance and jingoism persists. Jackson tries not to reinforce that stereotype — “I’m always respectful that I am a visitor,” he says — while being aware that this state of not belonging cuts both ways for the Black traveler. He writes in a 2010 essay of leaving one store in Brazil for another in search of cooking ingredients and being stopped by police who assumed the Black men in the car (a group that included Wiley) were buying drugs. The cops, like many men in the Rio de Janeiro favela, were armed. As Bland notes, biases of class, color, nationality, sexuality and gender “just shift around” from place to place. She describes being hounded by neo-Nazis in Germany and being propositioned in Italy, while dining alone, by men who assumed she was a prostitute. She has spent her life defying these assumptions, even if she can’t escape them. IT CAN BE hard to locate oneself among such shifting affiliations and prejudices, but also to affix one’s identity to spaces that are themselves always in flux. Jackson describes the changes he witnesses in Dakar — the dust storms and coastal tides, as well as the rapid urban development underway even during a pandemic. The spot where Bland, and then her children, once played in SoHo was converted into a dog park. Amid these changes, these artists turn to constants: Jackson’s methodical revision process, rewriting everything as he incorporates edits to his novel in progress; the decision Ladd made, long ago, to privilege family over work. (“This is totally off the record,” he tells me, “because I don’t want my family to develop some kind of neurosis ... but they’re kind of my platinum record.”) These artists are also grounded by global struggle — the Black Lives Matter protests in the United States, as well as their counterparts around the world. While Ladd and Bland believe there is a more advanced, longstanding conversation about race in America — one that Bland believes may spur a “reverse exodus” of people of color to the States — Jackson notes that people have recently taken to the streets of Dakar to contest political leadership; and Gallagher sends me photos from a June 2020 protest in the Netherlands staged in support of American B.L.M. activists, and also to contest local racist violence: thousands of people stretching over the River Maas on Rotterdam’s Erasmus Bridge. The potential for people of diaspora to make a place for themselves in the world among far-reaching kin is encoded in the title of Gallagher’s 2013 Tate Modern retrospective, “AxME.” A nod to the Black American vernacular (“ask me”), the title also signifies the artist’s desire to hack through Western fantasies of innocence and purity; while also, as Gallagher’s friend the historian Robin D.G. Kelley points out in a catalog essay, reaching back to Africa to evoke the Yoruba word for life force, “Axé,” perhaps as a blessing. “What it means to be a Black creative person in the world — that is hard won,” Gallagher says. “And we share it over time.” She speaks of feeling “threaded” with other Black and brown people — an artisanal image that is also a natural metaphor, evoking a spider’s web. The threads that stretch and bind people are invisible and tenuous, but also intricate and durable. They come to the fore in moments of racial unrest. For the working artist, the threads of interconnection also expand in quotidian, practical ways: as curators of color from Asia and Africa exhibit Gallagher’s work, which is often passed over by major Dutch museums; as Ladd records a new album with the rappers Juice Aleem (from Birmingham, England) and Ngnima Sarr (a.k.a. Tie, who lives in Paris and Dakar). Their trio is called the Exillians, a name that speaks to the fugitive alliances of those who, like the maroons of the slavery era, are stateless, restless and intent on being left alone to create something new together. As Hartman writes in “Lose Your Mother,” “If the past is another country, then I am its citizen” — a Black American who inhabits the afterlife of slavery, as well as a keeper of the historical memory that binds her to Black people across time and space. These contemporary artists express a similar sense of kinship with the iconic Black travelers who preceded them. For Bland, Baker’s real genius was to blend the sounds of her African American heritage with “the exotic-erotic mannerisms that the public wanted to see” and “play this status game, where ‘We’ll learn your language, we’ll master it, so that you are now buying my product.’” She hopes to extend this legacy through her own subversive, syncretic work. Gallagher sees her life in Europe as made possible by travelers like Baldwin, who himself “could be in Paris” because of Caribbean and African writers, such as Aimé Césaire and Léopold Senghor, who came before him. Contemporary artists do not only inherit these legacies; they reinterpret them. Challenging the story that artists like Baldwin left the States for their art, Jackson notes, “They were just as often going to hide.” His remark reminds us of other, less glorified reasons Black Americans have left: Because they could, and were curious about what would come next.",9,2021,2021_q3
2021-09-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/15/business/media/red-ventures-digital-media.html," INDIAN LAND, S.C. — Lindsey Turrentine first heard of Red Ventures last fall, when it bought the venerable tech news site CNET, where she is the senior vice president in charge of content. She sat down at her kitchen table in Berkeley, Calif., and frantically started Googling to find out what it was. Her experience wasn’t uncommon. People working at the tourism guide Lonely Planet, the travel site The Points Guy and the health and medical information site Healthline were similarly blindsided in recent years, when Red Ventures bought up special interest publications in a multibillion-dollar shopping spree. Their Googling and mandatory corporate retreats led them to the company’s South Carolina headquarters, a 180-acre campus with a cluster of modern buildings, a fire pit, a six-lane bowling alley, spin room, pickle ball courts and 264 residences for employees who choose to live where they work. Red Ventures, which started as a digital marketing company, has attracted serious investments from private equity firms. Its location has helped obscure what is perhaps the biggest digital publisher in America, a 4,500-employee juggernaut that says it has roughly $2 billion in annual revenues, a conservative valuation earlier this year of more than $11 billion, and more readers, as measured by Comscore, than any media brand you’ve ever heard of — an average of 751 million visits a month. Here in Indian Land, I felt as if I were back in the Ping-Pong days of Silicon Valley in the early 2000s. Red Ventures has built a culture that blends warm enthusiasm, progressive social values and the ruthless performance metrics of the direct marketing business. The company found itself in the publishing business almost by accident, and is now leading a shift in that industry toward what is sometimes called “intent-based media” — a term for specialist sites that attract people who are already looking to spend money in a particular area (travel, tech, health) and guide them to their purchases, while taking a cut. It’s a step away from the traditional advertising business toward directly selling you stuff. Red Ventures, for instance, plans to steer readers of Healthline to doctors or drugs found on another site it recently acquired, HealthGrades, which rates and refers doctors. Red Ventures will take a healthy commission on each referral. At the center of the company is Ric Elias, the chief executive and co-founder. A 6-foot-5 native of Puerto Rico, he has quietly become one of the most powerful media moguls in the country, a Barry Diller of the South, heading a company roughly the size of Mr. Diller’s IAC. (Mr. Diller, a more typically immodest media figure, said in an email that he finds Mr. Elias “impressive” but that there is only one Barry Diller: “I think of myself as all points on the compass.”) Mr. Elias, who spoke with me in the company’s bright and sprawling cafeteria, had played basketball that morning with a former N.B.A. player who lives nearby. He is the largest shareholder in Red Ventures, with more than 20 percent of the company, and so a billionaire on paper — though he hasn’t done the self-promotion required to get on the Forbes list. “I think we’re a 20-year-old company that still is figuring out what we’re going to be,” he said. “And I don’t think we have anything to celebrate or tell.” If you’ve heard of Mr. Elias, it’s probably because you’re one of the eight million people who have watched the video of his TED Talk, “3 Things I learned When My Plane Crashed.” On the top floor of the main building on the Red Ventures campus, he pointed to his own blurred shape in a painting of passengers walking onto the wings of the Charlotte-bound US Airways Flight 1549, the jetliner that made an emergency landing on the Hudson River in 2009, the so-called “Miracle on the Hudson.” Mr. Elias’s seat was 1D. He returned from that near-death experience determined to remake his life — and his company. He devoted himself to causes, including a college scholarship program for undocumented immigrants ineligible for state aid, some of whom he has hired. And he started transforming Red Ventures, then a middleweight marketing company, into the kind of business where he would want to spend his career. “This is the perch from where I’m going to live the rest of my life,” he said, describing his thoughts at the time. “We’re not going public, we’re not selling. Red Ventures, as is, will never be a public company as long as I’m running it.” He persuaded key investors — the private equity firms General Atlantic and Silver Lake each own about 20 percent — to back an ambitious expansion. And now Red Ventures is the largest in a group of private equity-backed giants that have been snapping up trusted media brands once left for dead. North Equity bought Popular Science, Domino and Field & Stream, along with the men’s site Mel. J2 Media, a public company, scooped up the old publisher Ziff Davis with its online brands Mashable and IGN. In addition to Lonely Planet, CNET, Healthline and The Points Guy, Red Ventures bought the education advice site BestColleges. These low-profile media companies are riding a shift in technology as both Apple and regulators have eroded the dominance of the creepy advertising technology that allows companies to track you across websites. That has helped push the pendulum back toward the old-fashioned idea of connecting with readers seeking information relevant to their lives, whether it’s a Field & Stream article on the latest fly rods or a Healthline guide to Crohn’s disease treatments. That’s the context in which Red Ventures — a company that backed its way into media after specializing in online marketing — makes sense. Mr. Elias grew up in San Juan hearing stories of his late grandfather, a Lebanese immigrant who, according to family lore, built a huge produce importing business but lost it because he hadn’t paid his taxes. It recently occurred to him, he said, that he has spent his career trying to restore the family name. He arrived at Boston College, in 1986, a semester late because he’d been trying to make a local professional basketball team, the Leones de Ponce, and speaking what he described as broken English. From there, he earned an M.B.A. at Harvard Business School. In 2000, he and a friend, Dan Feldstein, who is now the chief marketing officer of Red Ventures, started a business built on the notion of driving online shoppers to physical stores. It was a “terrible idea,” Mr. Elias said, and they quickly ran out of money. They spent the next few years digging out and repaying their investors, among them their more successful Harvard Business School classmates. Mr. Elias and Mr. Feldstein sold the business to management in 2005 and started again under the name Red Ventures, becoming pioneers in that era’s efforts to link digital data and real world commerce. They entered the business of selling subscriptions for DirecTV and burglar alarms for ADT Security. Along the way, they figured out how to integrate online marketing and old-fashioned telemarketing — and they got very good at search engine optimization. Other tricks were more ingenious. For instance, they purchased more than a million toll-free phone numbers, and each visitor to their marketing website was shown a different one. So when prospective customers called, Red Ventures knew exactly what they had been looking at on the site, which gave the agents what they needed to make personalized sales pitches. This was a pretty high-tech form of digital surveillance in those more innocent times. As the company grew and the market shifted, its founders realized that the technological know-how they had developed had itself become a commodity and that they needed to develop their own brands, not just sell others’. In 2015, Red Ventures raised $250 million, which went toward its $1.4 billion purchase of Bankrate, a personal finance company that helps people comparison shop for financial products (and earns a commission on each sale). That acquisition included The Points Guy, a site devoted to elucidating airline mileage programs and credit card deals. The Points Guy had built a profitable business earning commissions whenever people signed up for credit cards they had read about on the site — often in rave reviews of high-end cards. The marketing of financial products promises far higher profit margins than the online “affiliate” businesses that underlie websites like The New York Times’s Wirecutter. While a publisher recommending a gadget on Amazon might earn a single-digit percentage of a shopper’s purchase, the “bounties” paid to Red Ventures for directing a consumer to a Chase Visa Sapphire Reserve credit card or an American Express Rose Gold card can range from $300 to $900 per card. The arrival of Red Ventures’ executives hasn’t always gone over well among the journalists who find themselves working under Mr. Elias. Journalists, like members of a medieval guild (the guild hall is Twitter), tend to be more connected to the folkways of their profession than to any corporate culture, and some roll their eyes at Red Ventures’ rah-rah retreats, which feature fireworks and song. More troublingly, some reporters at The Points Guy, which also covers the travel industry in general (it has been a comprehensive source for information on where vaccinated Americans can travel), have complained that the new owners have eroded the already rickety wall between the site’s service journalism and the credit card sales that fund it. Red Ventures is “all about profit maximization,” said JT Genter, who left the site more than a year ago. He and other Points Guy writers said they hadn’t been pushed to publish stories they found dubious — indeed, the site has occasionally offered carefully critical coverage of Chase and American Express, its dominant business partners. But Points Guy journalists are required to attend regular business meetings detailing how much money the site makes from credit card sales, which some take as a tacit suggestion to put their thumbs on the scale. Mr. Elias said Red Ventures has a “nonnegotiable line” concerning the editorial independence of its sites, adding that he has given his cell number to CNET employees and instructed them to call him if they ever face pressure from the business side. “I told them, ‘There’s a red line,’ and they’re like, ‘OK, we’ll see,’” he said. Red Ventures’ roots in marketing, its investment in tech aimed at selling you something and its almost-accidental move into trying to provide readers with trusted, even journalistic, advice have made for an odd amalgam. And the company’s Silicon Valley style extends only so far. Most employees don’t receive equity in the company, and lunch isn’t free, just subsidized. The company does offer a maxim-happy workplace, though, with inspirational slogans printed on the walls of its atrium in cheery fonts. The one I heard executives refer to most was “Everything Is Written in Pencil,” a motto that makes sense for a company that has changed almost entirely from its marketing origins to become a leading purveyor of service journalism. And its executives seem to have absorbed the idea that they are selling trust, even if they don’t put it in the language of journalism professors. “Brand and trust are at the core of everything that we do,” said Courtney Jeffus, the president of the company’s financial services division, which includes Bankrate. “If you lose brand trust, then you don’t have a business.” There’s quite a bit of good news in the rescue of old media brands by Red Ventures and similar companies — CNET plans to hire 150 new employees this year, for instance. A deeper concern may be what it will mean to transform the internet’s independent arbiters into nothing more than the gaping maw of the sales funnel. Less gloomy, I think, is something else that Red Ventures represents: a challenge to the oligopolistic dominance of Amazon over the internet, and a model for independent media companies that have spent a generation either losing their core businesses to cheerfully ruthless tech giants or, at best, living on their scraps. For sites like Wirecutter, internet commerce often means, in practice, serving as an Amazon storefront, with revenue trickling in from modest commissions. But Red Ventures has succeeded by building a tech and media company that is independent of that particular Goliath, if not of another one — Google. “We’re going to have a chance to be an alternative to the big walled gardens,” Mr. Elias said of his company. “This is a plane that just got some altitude.” The talk of planes prompted me to ask Mr. Elias how he got back to the Carolinas after the Hudson River landing. He said he’d told a surprised agent he wanted the next flight out. “The lady looked at me like I was crazy,” he recalled, but he’d figured that “if I don’t get on a flight right away, I may never fly again — and if the next flight goes down, it was me God was coming to see.”",9,2021,2021_q3
2021-09-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/05/business/biden-electric-vehicles.html," The White House said on Thursday that it was aiming for half of all new vehicles sold by 2030 to be electric powered, portraying the shift to battery power as essential to keep pace with China and to fight climate change. President Biden announced the target on Thursday as part of a plan that will also include construction of a nationwide network of charging stations, financial incentives for consumers to buy electric cars, and financial aid for carmakers and suppliers to retool factories for electric vehicles. “Folks, the rest of the world is moving ahead. We’ve just got to step up,” Mr. Biden said on Thursday. The president is also seeking to tighten fuel economy standards that were rolled back by former President Donald J. Trump. Electric vehicles account for a much higher share of auto sales in Europe and China because of incentives for consumers and government regulation. In June, less than 4 percent of the new cars sold in the United States were pure electric vehicles or plug-in hybrids, according to Argonne National Laboratory. “Despite pioneering the technology, the U.S. is behind in the race to manufacture these vehicles and the batteries that go in them,” the White House said in a statement. “Today, the U.S. market share of electric vehicle sales is only one-third that of the Chinese electric vehicle market.” The Biden administration’s target is generally in line with what the major American carmakers have set for themselves. Virtually all major U.S. automakers as well as numerous foreign automakers endorsed the plan, though they described the target as 40 percent to 50 percent electric vehicles and said it would be possible only with enough charging stations for millions of cars. “We look forward to working with the Biden administration, Congress and state and local governments to enact policies that will enable these ambitious objectives,” Ford Motor, General Motors and Stellantis, which owns Jeep and Chrysler, said in a joint statement. The United Automobile Workers union expressed support for the plan, as did BMW, Honda, Volkswagen and Volvo.",9,2021,2021_q3
2021-09-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/12/us/politics/taliban-afghanistan-us-embassy.html," WASHINGTON — American negotiators are trying to extract assurances from the Taliban that they will not attack the U.S. Embassy in Kabul if the extremist group takes over the country’s government and ever wants to receive foreign aid, three American officials said. The effort, led by Zalmay Khalilzad, the chief American envoy in talks with the Taliban, seeks to stave off a full evacuation of the embassy as they rapidly seize cities across Afghanistan. On Thursday, the State Department announced it was sending home an unspecified number of the 1,400 Americans stationed at the embassy and drawing down to what the agency’s spokesman, Ned Price, described as a “core diplomatic presence” in Kabul. The embassy also urged Americans who were not working for the U.S. government to immediately leave Afghanistan on commercial flights. The Taliban’s march has put embassies in Kabul on high alert for a surge of violence in coming months, or even weeks, and forced consulates and other diplomatic missions in the country to shut down. American diplomats are now trying to determine how soon they may need to fully evacuate the embassy should the Taliban prove to be more bent on destruction than a détente. “Let me be very clear about this: The embassy remains open,” Mr. Price said on Thursday. “And we plan to continue our diplomatic work in Afghanistan.” Mr. Price said the heightened pace of the Taliban’s rout, leading to increased violence and instability across Afghanistan, was of “grave concern.” “So given the situation on the ground, this is a prudent step,” he said. Five current and former officials described the mood inside the embassy as increasingly tense and worried, and diplomats at the State Department’s headquarters in Washington noted a sense of depression at the specter of closing it, nearly 20 years after U.S. Marines reclaimed the burned-out building in December 2001. Several people gloomily revived a comparison that all wanted to avoid: the fall of Saigon in 1975, when Americans stationed at the U.S. Embassy were evacuated from a rooftop by helicopter. The fears underscore what was unfathomable just a few years ago, when thousands of American forces were in Afghanistan and the U.S. Embassy in Kabul hosted one of the largest diplomatic staffs in the world. Mr. Khalilzad is hoping to convince Taliban leaders that the embassy must remain open, and secure, if the group hopes to receive American financial aid and other assistance as part of a future Afghan government. The Taliban leadership has said it wants to be seen as a legitimate steward of the country, and is seeking relations with other global powers, including Russia and China, in part to receive economic support. Two officials confirmed Mr. Khalilzad’s efforts, which have not been previously reported, on the condition of anonymity to discuss the delicate negotiations. A third official said on Thursday that the Taliban would forfeit any legitimacy — and, in turn, foreign aid — if it attacked Kabul or took over Afghanistan’s government by force. Other governments are also warning the Taliban that they will not receive aid if they overrun the Afghan government, given the rampage its fighters have waged across the country in recent days. On Thursday, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas of Germany said Berlin would not give the Taliban any financial support if they ultimately rule Afghanistan with a hard-line Islamic law. In other posts around the world, U.S. diplomats said they were closely watching the perilous situation in Kabul to see how the State Department would balance its longstanding commitment to stabilizing Afghanistan against protecting the Americans who remain there as military forces withdraw. Ronald E. Neumann, who was the American ambassador to Afghanistan from 2005 to 2007, described a push and pull between the Pentagon and the State Department in similar situations, given the military’s responsibility for carrying out evacuations and diplomats’ duty to maintain American assistance and influence even in danger zones. “If the military goes too early, it may be unnecessary, and it may cost you a lot politically,” said Mr. Neumann, who is now the president of the American Academy of Diplomacy in Washington. “If the diplomats wait too late, it looks like Saigon off the roof or the departure from Mogadishu after everything was already lost, and it puts the military people at risk. So there’s no guaranteed right side.” Another senior U.S. official expressed alarm this week at the fall of the provincial capitals across Afghanistan, and said that if other cities follow, particularly Mazar-i-Sharif, the only major northern city still under government control, the situation could disintegrate quickly. Officials in Washington and Kabul said the embassy was holding regular meetings of an emergency action committee, which is set up in every American diplomatic post to assess whether or how soon an evacuation may be necessary. The content of the meetings is classified because, in part, they review intelligence about specific attack scenarios. Spokespeople from the State Department headquarters in Washington and the U.S. Embassy in Kabul would not discuss how often the committee was meeting, but other officials said its members were holding discussions daily. The committee can only make recommendations, and it would be up to the embassy’s top-ranking diplomat — in this case, Ross Wilson, the chargé d’affaires in Kabul — to order an evacuation after consulting with senior officials in Washington. On Thursday, Mr. Wilson warned the Taliban that “attempts to monopolize power through violence, fear and war will only lead to international isolation.” Starting in April, the embassy began sending home nonessential employees as security became more untenable in Kabul. Other staff members have been allowed to leave, without penalty to their careers, if they feel in danger. Who are the Taliban? The Taliban arose in 1994 amid the turmoil that came after the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan in 1989. They used brutal public punishments, including floggings, amputations and mass executions, to enforce their rules. Here’s more on their origin story and their record as rulers. Who are the Taliban leaders? These are the top leaders of the Taliban, men who have spent years on the run, in hiding, in jail and dodging American drones. Little is known about them or how they plan to govern, including whether they will be as tolerant as they claim to be. One spokesman told The Times that the group wanted to forget its past, but that there would be some restrictions. How did the Taliban gain control? See how the Taliban retook power in Afghanistan in a few months, and read about how their strategy enabled them to do so. What happens to the women of Afghanistan? The last time the Taliban were in power, they barred women and girls from taking most jobs or going to school. Afghan women have made many gains since the Taliban were toppled, but now they fear that ground may be lost. Taliban officials are trying to reassure women that things will be different, but there are signs that, at least in some areas, they have begun to reimpose the old order. What does their victory mean for terrorist groups? The United States invaded Afghanistan 20 years ago in response to terrorism, and many worry that Al Qaeda and other radical groups will again find safe haven there. On Aug. 26, deadly explosions outside Afghanistan’s main airport claimed by the Islamic State demonstrated that terrorists remain a threat. How will this affect future U.S. policy in the region? Washington and the Taliban may spend years pulled between cooperation and conflict. Some of the key issues at hand include: how to cooperate against a mutual enemy, the Islamic State branch in the region, known as ISIS-K, and whether the U.S. should release $9.4 billion in Afghan government currency reserves that are frozen in the country. One diplomat said a number of what he described as small military elements have recently been brought in to reinforce the embassy, which is inside what is probably already the most hardened compound in Kabul’s international zone, where diplomatic missions and the Afghan government are based. At the same time, officials said, fewer diplomats are rotating into Kabul to replace colleagues who have left to further cull the number of Americans posted there. That has raised concerns in the American diplomatic corps that the embassy would have trouble recruiting staff for years to come. “It’s a wrenching time,” said Eric Rubin, the president of the union that represents career foreign service officers and who is a former ambassador to Bulgaria. He said about one-quarter of the current U.S. diplomatic corps have been posted to either Afghanistan or Iraq over the last 20 years and remain emotionally invested in the war zones in which they worked. “There was a lot of sacrifice,” Mr. Rubin said. “Everyone who served there for the most part served without their families, and under difficult conditions; at times under mortar fire. So it wasn’t easy.” As recently as last month, senior officials at the embassy in Kabul voiced confidence that personnel there could be evacuated quickly if necessary, noting a sufficient number of commercial flights leaving from the capital’s international airport every day could accommodate the compound’s staff. It is not clear, however, whether an evacuation would include all of the embassy’s foreign personnel along with American citizens, and the fate of Afghan employees who would all but certainly be targeted by the Taliban for aiding the United States is of acute concern to senior officials, according to several people familiar with the discussions. Officials also said the Biden administration is concerned that an evacuation of the American Embassy could create a domino effect that accelerates the departure of other diplomatic missions and international support — and, in turn, leads to the collapse of the Afghan government. “I am quite sure that no one in our Foreign Service who’s involved in this effort is advocating closing down the embassy and evacuating,” Mr. Rubin said. While decisions about the embassy’s security are on the horizon, he said, “there’s no reason to think that there’s an imminent security threat to our people.” “The first thing is, obviously, the mission, and the mission is changing,” Mr. Rubin said. “But I don’t think anybody’s going to propose to walk away.” Helene Cooper contributed reporting from Washington, and Thomas Gibbons-Neff from Kabul, Afghanistan.",9,2021,2021_q3
2021-09-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/17/briefing/taliban-haiti-breakthrough-infections.html," Taliban leaders provided assurances online and to the news media that they would not carry out reprisal killings or seize property after their takeover in Afghanistan. But there were ominous signs that their promises did not match the situation on the ground. Here are the latest updates and scenes from Kabul — and an overview of the group and its history. At the Taliban’s first news conference, a spokesman said they would allow women to work and study — but “within the bounds of Islamic law.” Despite this more moderate front, Afghan women expressed deep anxiety as they try to assess their future under Taliban control. Millions are afraid of a return to the repressive past, in which women had few opportunities or freedoms. Classified reports from American spy agencies leading up to Kabul’s collapse had painted a grim picture of the prospect of a Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, even as the Biden administration said publicly that the takeover was unlikely to happen imminently. From Opinion: Malala Yousafzai, who survived a Taliban assassination attempt in Pakistan after speaking out about her right to go to school, writes, “Like many women, I fear for my Afghan sisters.” Resettlement: Britain and Canada announced that they would each take 20,000 Afghan refugees who had fled the country. Sweden said it would divert aid from Afghanistan so that it would not contribute to Taliban rule. View from abroad: Afghans who have settled in the U.S. in the past two decades described anguished conversations with family members and the piercing fear that the Taliban might retaliate against their relatives. News analysis: The desperate scenes at Kabul’s airport will now give Afghanistan a place in America’s national memory as another failed attempt to reshape a far-off land. At least 1,941 people are dead, and 9,900 injured, after a 7.2-magnitude earthquake in Haiti over the weekend was followed by the arrival of Tropical Storm Grace, which soaked survivors as they struggled to keep safe in makeshift shelters. The storm has complicated an already tenuous earthquake relief effort, disrupting an air bridge run by humanitarian groups and the U.S. Coast Guard between affected areas of southern Haiti and the capital, Port-au-Prince. Efforts to recover victims of the quake have been slow and have been hampered further by heavy rain, which had largely stopped yesterday. People in afflicted areas searched for loved ones and supplies and tried to get aid from humanitarian groups. Many had sought refuge in the few public buildings spared by the quake. Quotable: “In a situation like this, you feel you’re powerless,” said Abiade Lozama, an Anglican archdeacon based in the south of the country. “Many people are in need, and there’s nothing you can do.” With the arrival of the highly contagious Delta variant, Covid-19 hospitalizations and deaths among vaccinated Americans may also have increased, according to preliminary figures from seven states. In six of those states, breakthrough infections in vaccinated people accounted for at least one in five newly diagnosed cases, according to figures gathered by The New York Times. Absolute numbers remain very low, however, and there is little doubt that the vaccines remain powerfully protective. The figures come as Biden administration officials plan to recommend that most Americans receive coronavirus booster vaccinations eight months after their second shots. Health workers hope the boosters will help relieve overwhelmed Covid wards — one in five intensive care units in the U.S. has nearly every bed occupied. Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic. In other developments: Getting vaccinated against Covid-19 is “an act of love,” Pope Francis says in a public service ad that will start circulating online and on television today.

Cuba’s health care system, long a source of national pride, is in acute distress after the Delta variant swept across the country. India’s Covid numbers have fallen, but a third wave still looms.

Other pieces, like Andy Warhol’s acrylic silk-screens of Pelé, are little more than simple tributes to great athletes. Eddy Frankel, an art critic and a co-founder of the gallery, said he wanted to show that art about football, as soccer is known in Britain, could be exciting, complex and thought-provoking. “We’re using football to express ideas about society,” Frankel said. “If you want to talk about racism, bigotry, homophobia, or if you want to talk community and belief and passion: All of that, you can with football.” Kuku paka is a rich Kenyan dish of chicken in a spiced coconut sauce.

2021-09-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/02/us/eviction-moratorium-housing-biden.html," With the federal moratorium on evictions having expired over the weekend, the White House on Monday sought to limit the impact, demanding that states speed up disbursement of billions in bottled-up rental aid, while pleading with local governments to immediately enact their own extensions. President Biden — under fire for refusing to extend the freeze and eager to prove he was taking some action — announced a series of limited moves Monday afternoon aimed at slowing evictions, directing federal agencies to consider targeted moratoriums for tenants in federally subsidized housing and asking state judges to slow-walk eviction proceedings. The moratorium, imposed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last fall, lapsed on Saturday after a frenzied, failed effort on Capitol Hill to extend the freeze through the end of the year, putting hundreds of thousands of tenants at risk of losing shelter. “There is just a lot of fear out there right now,” said Bob Glaves, executive director of the Chicago Bar Foundation, which has been working with tenants and landlords to tap a $47 billion fund allocated by Congress to pay off back rent accrued during the pandemic. Legal aid groups and other tenants’ organizations have reported a massive flood of phone calls and emails from renters panicked by the end of the eviction freeze, which occurred at midnight on Saturday. On Monday, administration officials made it clear they could only do so much, blaming states for the fact that the $47 billion Emergency Rental Assistance program intended to avoid such a crisis has disbursed only $3 billion — or just 7 percent of the total. “We expect these numbers to grow, but it will not be enough to meet the need, unless every state and locality accelerates funds to tenants,” Gene Sperling, who is overseeing pandemic relief efforts for Mr. Biden, told reporters at the White House.  “There is no place to hide for any state or locality failing to accelerate their emergency rental assistance funds,” he said. But many Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have called on Mr. Biden to reconsider his decision not to act unilaterally, and have expressed anger at the White House for giving them only two days to ram through legislation to extend the freeze. “People were promised something — help — and that has not happened,” said Representative Cori Bush, Democrat of Missouri, who has been sleeping on the steps of the Capitol to protest the end of the moratorium. “It is unbelievable. It is shocking. It is unconscionable. It is cruel. We can’t be sitting on our hands when people are suffering.” On Thursday, Biden administration officials punted the issue to congressional Democrats, claiming that a recent Supreme Court ruling made it nearly impossible to order an extension without jeopardizing the right of the executive branch to implement similar emergency policies during future public health crises. Since then, Biden administration officials have worked the phones, appealing to the states to stop, or even slow, landlords from evicting renters until the balky funding pipeline — which has been plagued by delays — is functional. Over the weekend Mr. Biden called Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the C.D.C. director and the official with the authority to extend the freeze, to explore the possibility of limiting an extension to areas hit especially hard by the Delta variant, but was told that was not possible. “Everybody” in the West Wing wanted to extend the moratorium, Mr. Sperling said in an interview. “But what was clear from the legal analysis was that we had already litigated this issue all the way to the Supreme Court.” In a related move, the Treasury Department on Monday issued guidance for how states can spend up to $10 billion in financial assistance to people in danger of losing their homes to foreclosure.  The money can be doled out to borrowers who have fallen behind on mortgage payments, according to the guidance, but also to people who have taken out loans to buy mobile homes to live in, or who acquired a home in a contract for deed relationship — a loan financed by the seller of the property.",9,2021,2021_q3
2021-09-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/01/opinion/aging-nursing-homes.html," Few people dream of living out their golden years in a nursing home. The very idea sparks existential dread in many Americans, conjuring images of grim, institutional dumping grounds where society’s frailest and most vulnerable members aren’t so much cared for as warehoused. Scattered horror stories of neglect and abuse supercharge more prosaic fears about losing one’s autonomy. The coronavirus pandemic made things all the more terrifying, tearing through facilities with brutal efficiency. The official Covid-19 death toll in U.S. nursing homes stands at more than 133,000, accounting for more than 1 in 5 of the nation’s pandemic fatalities. Even prepandemic, most Americans said they wanted to age at home — 76 percent of those 50 and older, according to a 2018 survey by AARP. The vast majority — over 90 percent of those 65 and older — are already doing just that. Looking to ease the strain this can put on families, President Biden has called for a $400 billion investment in home- and community-based care. Experts cheer the effort as crucial to addressing the challenges of America’s fast-graying population, a trend fueled by better medical care, longer life spans and a flood of aging baby boomers. But the need for institutional care will not vanish. The United States had around 15,600 nursing homes serving 1.3 million residents, most 65 or older, as of 2015-16 (the most recent data available). Even with additional resources, many seniors will require more support than can be provided at home. And the demographics are daunting: The number of Americans age 85 and older is expected to top 19 million by 2050. American nursing homes are creatures of the last century. They sprang up in the 1930s as a gentler alternative to poor houses and later proliferated thanks to various government programs. As the name suggests, they take a highly medicalized approach to aging, and, by design, are reminiscent of hospitals. Improvements in home-based care, including telemedicine, are enabling more people to remain at home longer. Assisted living and continuing-care communities are springing up, offering elaborate care, especially for more affluent seniors. This leaves traditional nursing homes as the province of the poorest and sickest — those with few other options. Complicating matters is the bifurcated population and how the bills get paid. On one side are short-term residents, who usually arrive after a hospital stay. On the other side are long-haulers needing custodial care, mostly seniors and the severely disabled. Most short stays in nursing homes are paid for by Medicare, which reimburses facilities at a much higher level than Medicaid, which covers extended-stay residents. Nursing homes have long relied on their Medicare cohort to subsidize their Medicaid population. This dynamic is being disrupted as more people receive post-acute care elsewhere. With people living longer and requiring more advanced services, the costs of long-term stays are going up. Worse, many older facilities need extensive, and expensive, capital improvements. Well before the current labor crunch, the industry was plagued by staff shortages and high turnover — a byproduct of demanding, poorly compensated work. (The average hourly wage for nursing assistants hovers around $14.) Under pressure, the industry has been experiencing a wave of closures and consolidations. Smaller nonprofit nursing homes are being closed or swallowed by for-profit entities, even as smaller for-profits are absorbed by large corporations. Private-equity firms have also become a major industry player. On the whole, nonprofit facilities provide a higher quality of care, and private-equity has a particularly troubling reputation. Covid 19 turned nursing homes’ chronic operating problems into emergencies. From January 2020 to January 2021, nursing home occupancy fell nationwide more than 16 percent. In a survey released in June, 54 percent of nursing homes said they were operating at a loss and only a quarter of nursing homes and assisted living facilities expressed confidence they could survive another year. With the industry in crisis, experts and advocates believe the time is ripe for an overhaul. Among the more interesting reform possibilities being discussed is a shift toward smaller, more self-contained, unconventional facilities that reflect the evolving attitude toward aging. Unconventional nursing homes have been generating buzz for a couple of decades. Among the best-known are those associated with the Green House Project, a nonprofit group that opened its first one in 2003 in Tupelo, Miss. Green House properties strive to provide residents with a homier atmosphere and a greater sense of agency than traditional facilities. Homes serve 10 to 12 residents, whose schedules are, to varying degrees, less regimented. The buildings resemble ranch-style houses. Residents have private rooms and bathrooms organized around a communal area for cooking, eating and socializing. Green House follows a practice of consistent assignment, in which aides stick with the same residents, helping them with a range of activities, including cooking, laundry and personal care. Advocates say this helps residents and aides build closer relationships — and limits the vectors for disease transmission. Aides receive specialized training and are typically paid above the industry average. Green House facilities have been adapted to accommodate specific populations, such as veterans, dementia patients and people suffering from multiple sclerosis. Multiple cottages are typically clustered together in residential areas. Some are placed on the campuses of larger senior communities or even public housing. Where space is tight, communities can be set up on the individual floors of a high-rise building. Research indicates clinical advantages to this care model, finding Green House residents less likely than residents in traditional facilities to require hospitalization, to wind up bedridden, to develop pressure ulcers or to need catheters. (Fewer hospitalizations have translated into lower Medicare costs.) Other studies show lower turnover among the staff and higher levels of satisfaction among aides, residents and residents’ families. Despite their promise, there are only about 300 Green House homes operating in 32 states, serving some 3,200 residents. There are regulatory and financing hurdles to setting up these facilities. And the homes cost more to establish and to operate. For an industry already facing financial challenges, it can be a hard sell. But in the Covid era, these alternatives are getting new attention. Research shows that Green House homes weathered the early pandemic far better than traditional facilities. Through July of last year, the Green House Project reported 32.5 positive Covid-19 cases and 2.84 deaths per 1,000 senior residents in its facilities, compared with 146 cases and 38 deaths per 1,000 residents in certified nursing homes overall. The need for innovation and reform in the industry is glaring. As the pandemic drove home, the status quo is as undesirable as it is unsustainable. Something has got to give, for the sake of the millions of seniors who will continue to rely on these institutions. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2021-09-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/25/business/media/jeopardy-mike-richards-executive-producer.html," Last week, Mike Richards lost his gig as the new host of “Jeopardy!,” faced a rebuke from the Anti-Defamation League, heard an outpouring of dismay from the show’s demoralized staff, and was forced to apologize after it was revealed he made sexist and crude jokes on a podcast several years ago in which he mocked women’s appearances, unemployed workers and the size of Jewish noses. This week, Mr. Richards is back running the show. And his bosses at Sony appear intent on keeping it that way. In a show of defiance that has baffled Hollywood, Sony Pictures Entertainment has signaled that it will keep Mr. Richards on as executive producer of “Jeopardy!” and “Wheel of Fortune.” During a call with “Jeopardy!” staff on Monday, Sony’s top TV executive, Ravi Ahuja, made clear that the studio supported Mr. Richards, according to several people briefed on the call who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal conversations. Mr. Ahuja praised Mr. Richards for his willingness to step down from the hosting job, saying it was the right move for “Jeopardy!,” and signaled that he expected the crew to move forward from last week’s uproar with Mr. Richards in charge, the people said. He lamented the media coverage of Mr. Richards and instructed the staff not to speak to reporters. Mr. Ahuja also invoked his own upbringing as an Indian American who grew up in the 1970s in Mississippi, where, he said, he faced racially offensive remarks, to emphasize that he was sensitive to concerns about Mr. Richards’s crude comments, the people said. Mr. Richards has agreed to undergo sensitivity training, the people said. On the call, Mr. Richards apologized again for his behavior and asked for an opportunity to prove “who he really is,” according to his spokesman, Ed Tagliaferri. Mr. Tagliaferri also swatted away the notion that Mr. Richards might be negotiating an exit from Sony, saying, “Mike is committed to continuing as the executive producer of ‘Jeopardy!’ and ‘Wheel of Fortune.’” Sony has tapped a veteran business and legal affairs executive at the studio, Suzanne Prete, to oversee Mr. Richards at the show and “take more of an active presence on the creative direction and strategy.” Sony said that the new role for Ms. Prete, who will also oversee the business side of the show, was planned before last week’s uproar. She will report to Mr. Ahuja. Sony declined to make Mr. Ahuja available for an interview. Mr. Richards is back on set this week taping episodes with Mayim Bialik, who has temporarily taken over weekday hosting duties. A Sony spokeswoman referred to a statement issued last week, in which Sony expressed “hope” that Mr. Richards would carry out his producing duties “with professionalism and respect.” Hollywood insiders had widely expected Mr. Richards and Sony to be negotiating his exit after a report in The Ringer revealed a string of past offensive comments. In a podcast he recorded in 2013 and 2014, while serving as executive producer of “The Price Is Right,” Mr. Richards called his female co-host a “booth slut” because she once worked as a model at a consumer trade show, asked if she had “booby pics” on her cellphone, mocked women who wear one-piece swimsuits as “really frumpy and overweight” and referred to stereotypes about Jews and large noses. Former employees of “The Price Is Right” had also filed lawsuits that accused Mr. Richards of making sexist and misogynist comments on-set, including balking when a model he had hired for the show revealed she was pregnant with twins. (Mr. Richards disputes those claims.) Some “Jeopardy!” fans were already skeptical of Mr. Richards, a virtually unknown figure who was named as Alex Trebek’s replacement despite helping to oversee the host audition process. Sony says it made its decision independently of Mr. Richards. But as executive producer, he had a hand in choosing the footage of each candidate that was screened for focus groups. The death of Alex Trebek. The longtime host of “Jeopardy!” died on Nov. 8, 2020, after having been diagnosed with Stage 4 pancreatic cancer in 2019. His passing prompted an outpouring of heartfelt memories and love from fans. The search for the next host. Following Mr. Trebek’s death, more than a dozen guest hosts stepped behind the “Jeopardy!” podium. Some were just passing through, while others were clearly trying out for the permanent gig. Many fans were hopeful that LeVar Burton would get the job. New hosts were announced. After the parade of guest hosts ended, the game show decided that it would take not one — but two — people to fill Trebek’s shoes: Mike Richards, the show’s executive producer, was to become its new regular host and the actress Mayim Bialik would take over for prime time specials. Another twist. A week after the announcement, Mr. Richards announced he was leaving the role as host over controversy about offensive and sexist comments he made on a podcast several years ago. He later announced that he will leave the role of the program’s executive producer. Ms. Bialik has been filling in as weeknight host temporarily. The search continues. Ms. Bialik has made it clear that she would like the top job permanently, but scrutiny of her many past statements — including questioning vaccines and endorsing a disputed brain supplement — has now become the latest chapter in the saga that is the game show’s attempts to find a host who sticks. Meredith Vieira, the former “Today” show star, was one television personality who was eager to try out as a guest host. But she was not offered an audition, with the studio saying it was not interested in anyone currently hosting another game show, according to three people familiar with the audition process who spoke on the condition of anonymity. (Ms. Vieira hosts a syndicated show based on a board game called “25 Words or Less.”) Mr. Richards, an experienced game show host himself, was hired by Sony in 2019 from “The Price Is Right,” a tired franchise that Mr. Richards helped revive with Drew Carey as host. (Mr. Richards also auditioned for that hosting job.) He became executive producer of “Jeopardy!” last year, replacing Harry Friedman, an under-the-radar figure who exercised near-complete control of the program over a 25-year tenure. “Jeopardy!” is one of the more profitable assets in Sony’s American entertainment portfolio, but picking Mr. Richards as the host came with an added financial benefit. As a relatively obscure figure, he would command a smaller salary than better-known contenders like LeVar Burton or Anderson Cooper. Mr. Richards’s compensation as host and executive producer was believed to be significantly lower than Mr. Trebek’s pay. A segment of “Jeopardy!” viewers and aspiring contestants has expressed dissatisfaction with the decision to keep Mr. Richards as executive producer — some going so far as to re-evaluate their interest in the show because of his behavior. “If it was enough to disqualify him from being host,” said Jon Porobil, a 35-year-old “Jeopardy!” fan from Pittsburgh, “why isn’t it enough to disqualify him from being executive producer?” Matt Cappiello, 34, has taken the “Jeopardy!” entrance test multiple times, hoping to fulfill a lifelong dream of appearing on the show. But because of the controversy over Mr. Richards, he is now reconsidering. “It tarnished the reputation of the show for me,” said Mr. Cappiello, a copywriter who watches the show nightly from a bar in Brooklyn. “‘Jeopardy!’ is supposed to be a celebration of knowledge, and it’s being run by this guy who’s the personification of ignorance.” For all the criticism, Mr. Richards does have some supporters. Gwendolyn Osborne, a model who worked on “The Price Is Right” for more than 12 years and considers herself a friend of Mr. Richards, said she was shocked to learn about his podcast comments, saying they did not align with his behavior as a boss. Contrary to the behavior alleged in the pregnancy-discrimination lawsuit, she recalled that Mr. Richards supported her when she returned to work from maternity leave, and then years later when she became pregnant again. “I have reached out to him to tell him to continue to believe in his greatnesses, and that I do believe that everybody is worthy of redemption,” she said in an interview.",9,2021,2021_q3
2021-09-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/26/upshot/fed-climate-change-analysis.html," The climate crisis is at high risk of becoming an economic crisis. That is an increasingly widespread view among leading economic thinkers — that a range of economic and financial problems could result from a warming planet and humanity’s efforts to deal with it. But if you believe that to be true, what should the United States’ economist-in-chief do about it? That question has taken new urgency as President Biden weighs whether to reappoint Jerome Powell to another term leading the Federal Reserve or choose someone else. Climate activists and others on the left have argued that Mr. Powell should be replaced by someone with stronger credentials as a climate hawk. Demonstrators backing this cause were planning to protest at an annual Fed symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., starting Thursday, but the event was made online-only at the last minute because of a rise in coronavirus cases. Among other things, they want the Fed to use its regulatory powers to throttle the flow of bank lending to carbon-producing industries. At the same time, some Republicans are assailing the Fed for mere research efforts involving climate. It is clear there would be a huge outcry on the right if a new Fed chair were to take an activist stance in trying to limit the availability of capital in energy-extraction businesses. So far, Mr. Powell and other leaders at the central bank have taken a middle ground. They’ve committed to studying the ways global warming will affect the economy and the financial system, and they’re factoring those conclusions into their usual jobs of guiding the economy and regulating banks — but not trying to manage how loans and resources are allocated. Arguably, one of the more important things the Fed can do to help fight climate change is to excel at its primary job: maintaining a stable, strong economy. Consider some surprising public opinion data. Since 1989, Gallup has polled Americans about whether climate change worried them personally. The net share of people who have expressed concern — those who have said they worry about climate a “fair amount” or a “great deal” versus those who have worried “only a little” or “not at all” — offers a sense of how seriously Americans take the threat. The net share of people worried about climate change reached its peak not in recent years, when the damaging effects have become more visible. The peak was in April 2000, when the share of people worried about the climate was 45 percentage points higher than the share not worried. That was also one of the best months for the U.S. economy in decades, near the peak of the late 1990s boom, with unemployment a mere 3.8 percent. Two of the times when climate worry in the survey hit a low were in 2010 and 2011, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, when the net shares of those worried versus not worried were only four and three percentage points. Using a broader range of evidence from both the United States and Europe, two political scientists at the University of Connecticut, Lyle Scruggs and Salil Benegal, found that a decline in climate concern in that period was driven significantly by worse economic conditions, which increased worry about more immediate issues. In times of scarcity, people tend to think less of policies with long-term payoffs. “The state of the economy affects people’s sensitivity to the future versus the present,” Professor Scruggs said. “Historically climate change has fallen into the same camp as a lot of other environmental issues, where people’s answers tend to wax and wane with the economy.” If a central bank can achieve consistent prosperity, this research suggests, it may change some political dynamics on aggressive climate action. Prosperity could support branches of government that have more explicit responsibility for curtailing greenhouse gases, building out clean energy capacity, or helping communities adapt to more extreme weather. Not everyone who studies public opinion on climate agrees. Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, attributes the decline in concern about climate change in the early 2010s not to the weak economy, but to widening political polarization and a pivot of conservative media toward climate change denialism. “What we saw was a symbiotic relationship between conservative media, conservative elected officials and the conservative public,” he said. “That drove the shift. It wasn’t the economy.” A paper published this summer by Michael T. Kiley, a Fed staff member, analyzed how temperature variations affect economic performance. It concluded that climate change may not change the typical rate of growth in the economy over time, but could make severe recessions more common. A major crop failure, for example, would lower G.D.P. directly and could simultaneously create economic ripple effects such as bank failures. And Lael Brainard, a Fed governor and potential Biden appointee to become the next chair, has emphasized that the unpredictable nature of climate change could make obsolete the historical models on which economic policy is based. “Unlike episodic or transitory shocks, climate change is an ongoing, cumulative process, which is expected to produce a series of shocks,” she said in a March speech. “Over time, these shocks can change the statistical time-series properties of economic variables, making forecasting based on historical experience more difficult and less reliable.” If Ms. Brainard is correct, it raises a dispiriting possibility: As the planet gets hotter, it could make it harder to keep the economy on an even keel. But the worse the economy performs, the more toxic and dysfunctional climate politics may become.",9,2021,2021_q3
2021-10-02,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/25/health/school-covid-test.html," SAN ANTONIO — One recent Thursday, Ciara Brown, a junior at Fox Tech High School in San Antonio, stepped up to a small white table, pulled down her face mask and took a test that is still far from standard in American schools: a cotton swab up the nose. “Testing is super-easy,” she said. “It’s not as scary as I thought it would be — it’s not a huge thing going up in your brain.” The United States has struggled with Covid testing since the earliest days of the pandemic. Now, nearly two years in — and weeks into another Covid-disrupted school year — school systems across the nation are struggling with the role of testing in keeping children safe and in class. Some, like Ciara’s in Texas, have gone all in; others offer no Covid testing at all. And still others say they want to do more testing but lack the resources or have been tripped up by obstacles and delays. The numerous school districts in the San Antonio area reflect the nation’s political rifts. Some districts have adopted multiple precautions, including testing, to shield themselves from the virus. Some have few defenses. Even as t​he worst of the early testing supply shortages have eased, and states have received federal money, including $10 billion from the American Rescue Plan, to implement school-based Covid testing programs​, many school districts are still floundering. “There is just a lot more to testing than just swabbing a nose or spitting in a test tube,” said Dr. Laura Faherty, a pediatrician and researcher at the RAND Corporation who has studied school-based Covid testing. School systems like Ms. Brown’s that have managed to establish large-scale testing programs are a case study in how much effort is involved. San Antonio Independent School District offers weekly testing to every student and staff member, a commitment that requires proctors to collect nasal swabs on area campuses three days a week. A single collection event can take hours. But the program, a partnership with the nonprofit Community Labs, is largely voluntary, and despite the district’s efforts, many families have not enrolled; about 30 percent of students are participating. Ms. Brown, who has two immunocompromised family members, was eager to sign up. “I wouldn’t be able to live with myself knowing that if they got Covid it was because of me,” she said. “Knowing that I can keep them safe, myself safe, friends, even strangers safe is all that I really care about.” But in the Boerne Independent School District, where masks are optional, testing is also optional and only available in the campus clinic by appointment. While the district says that anyone who is sick should not come to school, symptomatic people will not be referred for testing or even sent home unless they are “unable to participate in instruction.” Dr. Heather Riebel, a pediatric cardiologist who has treated Covid patients, said she has been “so careful” not to bring the virus home. Now, she worries her children may be more likely to contract it at school. She has already pulled her fifth grader out of school once this fall, after he was exposed five times in one week to students infected with the virus. “It’s extremely disheartening,” Dr. Riebel said. (District officials did not respond to numerous interview requests.) Elsewhere in San Antonio, the Northside Independent School District has taken a middle ground: rapid-testing students and staff members who are symptomatic, although students can only be tested if parents consent. Superintendent Brian Woods has not ruled out the possibility of larger-scale screening if cases spike. But the district faces severe staffing shortages, making it difficult to scale up testing right now. “We’re not at that point yet,” he said. The district is doing contact tracing, but the rollout has been bumpy. One elementary school can consult cafeteria cameras to help identify students’ close contacts. But they were not working on the day Andrea Ochoa’s 10-year-old daughter ate lunch with a student who later tested positive. Ms. Ochoa, who has autoimmune issues, only found out about the exposure the following week, from her daughter. “I’m not upset that a child got sick,” Ms. Ochoa said. “But I don’t want gossip between little kids to be the way us parents figure out how to advocate for our children.” San Antonio is a microcosm of the patchwork of programs at schools across the country, even as the federal government invests more resources in testing. “While some of the logistics are getting easier, there’s a pretty fragmented approach from school district to school district as to whether and how testing is being used,” Dr. Faherty said. In Illinois, all public schools outside of Chicago are eligible for free SHIELD testing: weekly saliva tests developed by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. But neighboring Iowa turned down the $95 million it was allocated for testing under the American Rescue Plan. The state’s department of education says other resources are available for schools; some districts are distributing take-home test kits, which are available at no cost from the state laboratory. Even in states with coordinated programs, participation can be spotty. As of Sept. 21, just 24 percent of Virginia’s public school divisions had signed up for its federally funded testing program, which provides regular pooled P.C.R. testing and access to at-home test kits. Elsewhere, the late-summer spike of cases has left schools scrambling. “It’s a matter of playing catch-up,” said Dr. Richard Besser, president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the former acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “You can’t ask schools to implement broad-based testing protocols once the school year has already started, when there aren’t the supplies and the personnel and the logistics in place.” Illinois’s SHIELD program was bombarded by last-minute sign-ups; as of Sept. 21, 43 percent of participating public schools opted in after Aug. 23, a SHIELD representative said. The program takes three to six weeks to launch; several weeks into the school year, most participating schools have not yet started testing. Chicago Public Schools has its own repeatedly-delayed program. The district initially said weekly screening would be available to every student when schools opened on Aug. 30. The district now says the program will be fully operational by the end of September, attributing the delay to the need to conduct background checks on the testing company’s employees. Local parents have expressed frustration about shifting timelines and slow updates. “There is no clear line of communication,” said Debora Land, who has a high school sophomore in the district and is a parent representative on her local school council. “Parents have been asking, ‘What’s your plan, what’s your plan, what’s your plan?’” As of Sept. 17, just 3 percent of students had enrolled in the testing program, the district said. In New Orleans, the district has actively encouraged families to enroll in its weekly P.C.R. testing program — offering multilingual online sign-ups and enrolling in a state-run program that pays students to get Covid tests, said district spokesman Richard Rainey. But local schools have had to weather both Delta and Ida, a Category 4 hurricane that knocked out the city’s power, temporarily closed public schools and suspended testing. “We pivoted quickly after the storm passed to restart the regimen within a week,” Mr. Rainey said. The rising demand for testing has also strained supplies. In Fresno, Calif., the school district has been unable to replenish its stock of rapid antigen tests and has had to cut back on its testing of student athletes as a result. But the biggest challenge many schools face is staffing. Berkeley Unified School District used state money to hire seven people to staff its Covid testing team — and then dipped into its own coffers to hire 14 more. For many districts in lower-income communities, that kind of financial outlay may be impossible. “We need to make sure the resources are there, in particular, in the communities that have been hit the hardest,” Dr. Besser said. Protocols that work when transmission rates are low can become unsustainable when rates rise. Alachua County, Fla., allows quarantined students to return to school early if they test negative for the virus on the fifth day of their quarantine. During the worst of the August surge, nurses at some schools were testing as many as 40 to 50 quarantined students every morning. Schools had to hope that no one needed medical attention during the hour or two it could take to test all those students, said superintendent Carlee Simon. “Like a kid doesn’t have an asthma attack or, you know, anybody needs an EpiPen.” She added: “Our nurses had a full-time job before Covid. Now Covid is a job.” The workload has eased, but in the first month of school, 15 nurses quit. In Grapevine, Texas, the school district’s testing center saw so much demand in early September that appointments were booked up days in advance. Amy Taldo, who runs the site, said she lacked the staff to expand. “I need an army,” she said. And testing is only the first step. In San Antonio Independent, when students or employees test positive, a brigade of nurses conducts a laborious contact-tracing protocol. To identify the close contacts of a single high school student, Lynn Carpenter, a district nurse, asks all their teachers for detailed seating charts. “I’ve got to know, are they at desks, are they at tables, how far apart are the tables?” she said. If the student is an athlete, coaches get calls, too, with questions about practices and games.“It just kind of mushrooms out,” she said. Ms. Carpenter, who works from a windowless, bare-walled office, sometimes needs several days to complete a single case. She has had calls with seriously ill staff members, some of whom broke down in tears. “It’s a heart-wrenching job,” she said. A vaccine for children ages 5 to 11 could be authorized as soon as next month, further protecting elementary schools. But even then, it could be months until most young children are vaccinated — and many may never get the shots, Dr. Besser said. So schools are forging ahead with what they have: limited staffing and limited time. “I think it’s a very worthwhile thing that we’re doing,” Ms. Carpenter said. “I’m just looking forward to that day when this is behind us and I can go home.”",10,2021,2021_q4
2021-10-02,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/07/magazine/rural-public-education.html," One Saturday afternoon in late May, a few days before the end of his junior year, Harvey Ellington plopped onto his queen-size bed, held up his phone and searched for a signal. The 17-year-old lived in a three-bedroom trailer on an acre lot surrounded by oak trees, too far into the country for broadband, but eventually his cell found the hot spot his high school had lent him for the year. He opened his email and began to type. “Good evening! Hope all is well! Congratulations on being the new superintendent for the Holmes County Consolidated School District.” A week and a half earlier, the school board chose Debra Powell, a former high school principal and mayor of East St. Louis, Ill., to lead the rural school district that Ellington attended in the Mississippi Delta. Powell worked as an administrator at Ellington’s school before the pandemic, and she ran track with Jackie Joyner-Kersee when she was a teenager. Maybe, Ellington thought, Powell had what it took to turn the district around. Ellington’s fingers hovered over his cellphone screen. Soon he would be a high-school senior, and he wanted to sound perfect. He looked around his bedroom, first at the sign that said, “You are worth more than gold,” then at his dresser, where he’d propped a copy of Carter Woodson’s “The Mis-Education of the Negro” underneath a picture of the superintendent’s round-table meeting. Ellington served on the student advisory group his freshman year, and he was president his sophomore year, but the round table no longer existed. “I have laid out some ideas and changes I want to see,” he wrote to Powell. Ellington was 7 the first time someone told him the state of Mississippi considered Holmes a failing district. Holmes had earned a D or an F almost every year since then, and Ellington felt hollowed out with embarrassment every time someone rattled off the ranking. Technically, the grade measured how well, or how poorly, Ellington and his classmates performed on the state’s standardized tests, but he knew it could have applied to any number of assessments. His school didn’t have clubs, and even before the pandemic, they hardly went on field trips. Every year, teaching positions sat unfilled for months at a time. The football team often made the playoffs, but the field at the high school was inadequate, and so the squad had to travel 10 miles west to play outside an elementary school. “Let’s bring a Debate team!!” Ellington wrote. “lets bring back the 18 wheeler club, Lets bring organization for kids that love to write books especially myself. ... Let’s engage more with our kids so they can improve their ACT scores! Let’s bring some positive things around the community so kids can stay out of trouble after school! Let’s bring a big boys and girls club like a huge boys and girls club.” As he typed, Ellington could hear his younger brothers playing Xbox games in the living room. Ellington had spent most of 2020 guiding the 5- and 6-year-olds through their virtual school days as he tried to tune into his own lessons. After almost failing a class in the fall, he earned mostly B’s in the spring, but he couldn’t take another year of learning that way. Finally, he thought, they had reached the end of what people had been calling a lost year. In his email, Ellington didn’t mention any of the things he’d lost. He didn’t tell Powell he spent weeks waiting for Wi-Fi and a Chromebook, and he didn’t admit that he skipped parts of his classes as he cooked oatmeal and bacon for his brothers while his mother worked a nursing job an hour away. He didn’t explain that he needed the A.C.T. help as much as anyone. He took the test once during the pandemic, and he scored several points lower than the state average. He could take it again, but few students at his high school had scored higher. Ellington knew that teenagers elsewhere were eager to return to normal — to schools with clubs, air-conditioning and a reliable slate of certified teachers. But Ellington didn’t want to return to the normal he’d known. He wanted to believe the new superintendent would turn Holmes into the kind of high school that students elsewhere took for granted. He understood how difficult it would be for one person to make progress after years of systemic neglect. Maybe it would take a decade. Maybe he would be long gone. But the one thing Ellington knew he could offer was his experience, and so, he decided, if the new superintendent wrote back, he would tell her everything he learned over the last three years. “Please get back at me,” he typed. “This is so important to me! Let’s make it happen!!!!” Ellington spent much of his life daydreaming about leaving Holmes County. Lexington, the largest town in the area, has only a handful of sit-down restaurants and no movie theater. “We don’t even have a Walmart,” Ellington often complained. For teenagers, the lack of amenities meant there was nothing to do, but Ellington understood the deeper implications: In the United States, communities must pay for their own schools. Without businesses, Holmes didn’t have the tax base to give its children an adequate education. While researchers and activists have spent decades detailing the ways urban schools have failed children, students like Ellington are learning in more dire conditions. Most of the country’s poorest counties are rural, and two years ago, leaders at the Rural School and Community Trust, a national nonprofit group, found that decades of population loss and divestment by state governments has left many rural communities facing “nothing less than an emergency” when it comes to educating children. Nationwide, more than 9.3 million children — nearly a fifth of the country’s public-school students — attend a rural school. That’s more than attend the nation’s 85 largest school districts combined. And yet their plight has largely remained off the radars of policymakers. John White, the deputy assistant secretary for rural outreach at the U.S. Department of Education during the Obama administration, says that every time the nation or individual states roll out an education program, he searches for the word “rural.” “You either find one or two words or none at all,” he said. The problems rural schools face, White says, are distinct and require distinct solutions. Not only are rural communities more likely to be impoverished, they’re also often disconnected from the nonprofits and social-service agencies that plug holes in urban and suburban schools. Many don’t have access to broadband internet, and some don’t even have cellphone service, making it hard for young people to tap outside resources. Rural schools have a difficult time recruiting teachers and principals. And long before the pandemic turned “ventilation” into a buzzword for anxious parents, rural children were learning in aging buildings with broken HVAC systems and sewers too old to function properly. Money won’t solve all of those problems, White says, “but money and political will can do a whole lot for poor, rural communities.” The larger issue, he and other rural advocates argue, is that most states aren’t creating specific plans to address the myriad challenges rural communities face. For the last two decades, the Rural School and Community Trust has tried to change that by issuing biennial rankings of what it considers the highest-priority states when it comes to rural education. Mississippi has topped the list every year. Nearly half the state’s students attend a rural school, but its Legislature spends less than all but two others on rural instruction. This has left many of its rural districts, including Holmes, in a perpetual cycle of failure. Mississippi’s Department of Education doesn’t have any staff members dedicated to rural issues, and its most recent strategic plan doesn’t even include the word rural. But in 2016, when Ellington was in middle school, Republican lawmakers concluded that the best way to bolster Holmes was to consolidate it with Durant Public Schools, an even smaller and equally poor district 12 miles east, so that the districts could pool their resources. Leaders from Holmes and Durant begged state lawmakers to consider alternatives. Several states have tried consolidation, and studies have consistently found that forced mergers rarely save much money and often don’t boost student achievement. What Holmes and Durant needed, their leaders said, was more money from the state. Mississippi lawmakers have long known that rural districts can’t compete with wealthier suburban schools. In 1994, legislators even rolled out a new funding model designed to increase rural districts’ budgets. But the state has only fully funded the law three times in the last three decades, and leaders from Durant and Holmes argued that the shortfall had left both districts in a bind. (In the 2017-18 school year alone, the state shorted them by a combined $1.5 million.) The school buildings were too old and dilapidated to hold additional students, they said. Neither district had enough buses, and both needed computers and other modern technology. If the state didn’t want to give money, the Holmes superintendent suggested, it could at least send in educators to help improve the district’s graduation rate. Lawmakers consolidated anyway. A few schools closed, and the superintendents lost their jobs, but little else changed. Without more state support, the district was left to do what small, poor communities often must: Trust that a new leader, working without additional resources, could somehow fix decades of entrenched problems. And so, in early 2018, Holmes County board members set out to find the right person to lead the combined district toward success. James Henderson, the man the board selected, had never been a superintendent, but he had worked in St. Louis and Houston as a middle-school teacher, a human resources manager and a deputy superintendent. In his interview, he explained that he understood Holmes and its particular challenges because he grew up on a farm on the county’s north end. The district had struggled financially since the 1970s, and in 1982, the year after Henderson graduated, students averaged a score of nine on the A.C.T. — more than six points lower than the Mississippi average and less than half of the 18.4 nationwide mean. As he looked over the district’s latest test scores, he imagined a boy — someone a little like Ellington — growing up in conditions Henderson knew were subpar. The district’s average A.C.T. score rose to 15 in the years he was away — still three points below the state mean — but only 9 percent of Holmes students were proficient in math. Board members told Henderson that if he took the job, he would need to lift Holmes off the F list by summer 2020. Otherwise, the state might go beyond consolidating — it might take away local control entirely. For Henderson, the threat made the job more attractive. Most of Mississippi’s lawmakers and state school-board members were white. All but a dozen of Holmes County’s 3,000 students were Black. Henderson told himself he wouldn’t let white people decide what was best for Black students. Henderson moved to Holmes from Maryland the summer before Ellington’s freshman year. A few weeks into the fall semester, Henderson announced plans to bring clubs back to the high school. He started by creating the superintendent’s round table, and one morning, after teachers nominated candidates, a secretary used the intercom to call 17 students to the library. Most were the kind of overachievers who might have run for student council if one existed. The prospective valedictorian eventually joined, as did a champion rodeo rider. When the secretary announced Ellington’s name, the boy told himself he wouldn’t volunteer. He was quiet and a little anxious, and other kids bullied him. But after he stepped into the library, he changed his mind. Henderson almost seemed to radiate. His overcoat was so long it touched his ankles, and his blue-and-gold suit seemed to be brand-new. He looked, Ellington thought, like no one else in Mississippi. As Ellington drew closer, he smelled a cologne he assumed was expensive, and when Henderson reached for his hand, the teenager felt something new. Hope. Henderson crisscrossed the county his first year on the job. He would spend a morning in the Delta, talking to parents whose roads were so flooded that school buses could not travel down them; then he would speed east toward the tiny towns of Goodman or Pickens. At every stop, Henderson discovered a new challenge. The district didn’t have an electronic requisitions system; if a teacher needed supplies, she had to submit a paper copy, and sometimes, if a principal’s fan was blowing hard, that paper slipped onto the floor and was lost forever. Most of the elementary schools didn’t offer prekindergarten classes, and the high school, which had gone through four principals in two years, needed a new leader. The county is 756 square miles, and no school is especially close to another. Henderson spent hours just commuting. By fall 2019, as Henderson pushed past cotton fields and soybean farms toward Durant, the odometer on his district-issued Crown Victoria read 225,000 miles. Here are more fascinating tales you can’t help but read all the way to the end. Durant lost its high school in the consolidation, but an elementary school remained open in a century-old Art Deco building a block from the town’s main drag. The school didn’t have a parking lot, so that September Henderson pulled onto the grass, then headed toward the cafeteria, where he had invited staff members to lay out their complaints in what he called a Chat-n-Chew. Teachers drifted in around 10:30 a.m., and Henderson motioned toward a white card table, where an assistant had laid out sandwiches, juice and bags of chips. “Whatever’s on your mind, good, bad, ugly, indifferent, just talk to me,” Henderson said. “What can I do right now?” The teachers remained quiet as they waited for someone else to speak. Finally, a language-arts teacher said that most classrooms didn’t have textbooks. No one had science books, another teacher said, and the few reading materials instructors had were so outdated they didn’t even cover the skills kids would need to demonstrate on state tests. A music teacher who taught reading had grown so frustrated that he started bringing his own printer from home each week to run off scans of another instructor’s book. The teachers nodded. Most said they were paying for basic supplies themselves, though they earn less than teachers elsewhere do. The average teacher in Holmes made $44,000. Statewide, teachers earned an average of $47,000, and educators in Madison, an upscale, majority-white suburb outside Jackson, made close to $51,000. The state’s wages are particularly low — the Rural School and Community Trust found in 2018 that Mississippi’s rural teacher salaries are the sixth-lowest in the country — but the wage discrepancy between rural and other instructors is true across the United States. As the teachers grew more emboldened, Henderson held his wire-rimmed glasses in one hand and wrote notes on a legal pad with the other. “What else?” he asked. A kindergarten teacher explained that the county still didn’t have enough buses or drivers to operate them and so they picked up kids in shifts. Half the school’s students didn’t arrive until the first period was nearly over. The school didn’t have enough teachers either. Half the instructors were uncertified, and almost all of second grade was being taught by substitutes, meaning kids showed up for third-grade multiplication lessons not knowing how to add. Henderson promised the teachers that he would fill the second-grade positions, but he wasn’t sure how. As young people have gravitated toward cities, rural districts across the country have struggled to recruit qualified teachers. Lawmakers in Oklahoma and Washington have declared dire shortages, and in Montana, 65 percent of rural schools in remote settings reported difficulty filling vacancies in 2018, compared with 35 percent of nonrural schools. School leaders have yet to find solutions, in part because there’s no single reason for the shortage. Nationwide, enrollment in teacher-preparation programs has declined by more than one-third since 2010, and new instructors can afford to be choosy. Some have told researchers that they don’t want to live in towns with few amenities or jobs for their spouses. And while the pay is lower in rural schools, the work can be harder: When a district employs few qualified educators, certified instructors often find themselves having to teach multiple subjects. The most promising solution is one educators call “grow your own.” Under this model, rural districts encourage students to return home after college to teach. The idea is that young people who grow up in rural settings may be more likely to accept the bucolic life as an adult, but the model has one flaw: In order to grow its own teachers, a district must produce enough college graduates to fill its vacancies. Rural students are far less likely to go to college than their urban and suburban counterparts, and they’re less likely to finish once they start. Mississippi had more than 1,000 open positions the year Henderson took over, and a third of the state’s districts had a teacher shortage. The state has had a shortage since at least the 1990s. In 1998, legislators attempted to solve it by passing the Critical Teacher Shortage Act, a law that offered scholarships, loan repayment and moving reimbursements to instructors who agreed to teach in understaffed districts like Holmes. But by 2019, that shortage was six times worse than it was before the law took effect, according to a report in the nonprofit news site Mississippi Today. Policy analysts at the University of Arkansas have found that similar financial incentives did not work in their state, either. Lawmakers tried offering cash bonuses, loan forgiveness and mortgage help to attract teachers to rural districts. Still, Arkansas’s shortage remains. John White, the former federal employee who worked with rural schools, says that while hiring teachers can be a challenge in any district, rural leaders have told him they face problems few urban schools ever do. “I’ve talked to superintendents who say, ‘John, we don’t even get any applications,’” he told me. When Henderson became superintendent, roughly half of Holmes County teachers were long-term substitutes or uncertified workers who hadn’t passed the licensure exam. He had since booked a dozen recruiting events at local colleges and purchased 13 billboards across the state, imploring teachers to consider Holmes. He had netted a few applicants, but not enough to fill the district’s openings, so in his second year, he began helping uncertified workers earn their licenses. Just that week, he told the teachers at the Chat-N-Chew, he had started free night classes to show substitutes how to add and multiply fractions, skills they would need to demonstrate on the certification test. The teachers looked down at their sandwiches, all of which remained untouched. No one looked hopeful. “Anything else?” Henderson asked. The teachers said they needed paper and computer cords and at least one set of science textbooks that met state standards. By 11:30, Henderson had filled half his notebook. Eventually, a bell rang, the teachers left and three cheerful cafeteria workers took their place. The women told Henderson they had few complaints. Really, one woman whispered, there was only one. The school’s drainage had stopped working, and sewage was spilling onto the kitchen floors. That evening, after working 10 hours in Durant and Lexington, Henderson drove west until his GPS gave out and cotton blew like snow over the cracked windshield of his Crown Victoria. He parked at the end of a yellow dirt road on a lot wedged between a plantation and a school that had closed down years ago. It was 97 degrees, and the school didn’t have air-conditioning, but it was the only building in Mileston, Miss., big enough for a meeting, so Henderson had booked it for the kickoff of what he hoped would become his signature success — a school-bond campaign. The people who fought consolidation had been right, Henderson thought, when they told lawmakers that their buildings weren’t adequate. All but two of the county’s schools suffered from the kind of problems the Durant cafeteria workers identified that morning. Sewage bubbled from bathroom floors, and mold crept along classroom ceilings. One elementary school was cracked down to its foundation. Researchers have consistently found over the last several decades that young people who learn in newer, functional buildings outperform those who attend school in aging or substandard facilities. Students may grow distracted if their classrooms are too hot or too dim to make out the board, and schools with poor ventilation may leave children drowsy as hundreds of teenagers exhale carbon dioxide into the air. In the most dire situations — settings like the ones Holmes County students sat through every weekday — mold can sicken teachers and students enough to miss class. Henderson had seen the research, and he believed that many of his district’s problems led back to its buildings. How could he attract teachers to work in schools with raw sewage? How could students learn without qualified teachers? The problem was, Henderson couldn’t just replace the old schools. The district didn’t have enough money, and state lawmakers had made clear during the consolidation process that they didn’t intend to help Holmes pay for new facilities. That’s not unusual: Twelve states offer no support for construction, and only eight pay for more than half of local districts’ infrastructure. The federal government occasionally chips in FEMA money for disaster recovery, but its contributions have accounted for less than 1 percent of what the nation’s schools have spent on buildings. The result is what leaders at the nonpartisan group the [Re]Build America’s School Infrastructure Coalition call the “most regressive element of public-education finance.” Over the last decade, Mississippi’s urban and suburban districts have invested two and three times more than rural ones have into their facilities. If a school district wants a new building, its residents must agree to pay for it themselves by passing a school bond. In wealthy counties, that’s manageable, but Holmes suffered from a two-pronged dilemma: Not only were its residents poor, there also weren’t that many of them, and so each person had to cover a greater share of the cost. Henderson had been telling people that a bond was like a mortgage. If voters approved one, the district would borrow money from the bank, residents’ car and property taxes would go up and then, over the next two decades, the district would use those tax dollars to pay back the loan. Most of the district’s buildings were at least 50 years old, but Henderson knew he could never pass a bond big enough to replace every school. Instead, he and the board had decided to ask voters to approve an $18.4 million bond to rebuild the one school every student would eventually attend — its high school. In 1958, when its public schools still had white students, the county built the high school as a segregated institution for Black children. The Lexington Attendance Center for Negroes opened with a full library and a state-of-the-art science lab, but it had already begun to fall into disrepair by the time Henderson enrolled in the late 1970s, and little had been done to keep it up since. The photos hanging high on the brick walls were from the 1980s, and the classrooms were painted in the same dingy coat of pale yellow Henderson had disdained as a student. The only thing that had changed was the school’s name — first to J.J. McClain High School, after a beloved Black principal, then to Holmes County Central High School. A new high school would infuse the county with pride, Henderson believed. It would attract teachers and give teenagers like Ellington a fair shot at learning. But as Henderson waited outside the meeting, he knew that a tax hike would be a hard sell. He watched as two farmers wearing cowboy boots caked with mud climbed out of a pickup truck that looked at least 30 years old. Holmes was the poorest county in the poorest state, and Henderson was about to ask residents to collectively raise close to $20 million. He took a deep breath, then followed the men inside. By 6 p.m., 50 people sat on metal folding chairs that volunteers had arranged in the abandoned school. Henderson slipped toward the front, turned on the kind of projector schools used in the 1980s, then faced the crowd. “At the beginning of the school year, it was as hot as it was today,” he said. “Every school was just breaking down.” Every weekday, Henderson explained, 800 of the county’s teenagers crammed into a 61-year-old high school that had no air-conditioning, no heat and, some days, no running water. Most of the classrooms smelled like mold, and the hallways flooded when it rained. The outside was so antiquated that prospective teachers sometimes took one look, then peeled out of the parking lot. “Our kids can’t learn in those environments,” Henderson told the crowd. When he was a teenager, Henderson explained, he wanted to be a doctor. The Holmes County high school didn’t have a working science lab, but Henderson graduated intending to major in biology. On his first day at Jackson State University, a historically Black school an hour away, he realized that his classmates had gone to schools with labs. Everyone else had dissected frogs or small mammals. Everyone else had poured chemicals into test tubes. Henderson abandoned his dream, switched to communications and eventually earned his Ph.D. But he never got over the humiliation. “That’s why it’s time for us to do what we need to do,” Henderson announced. The district could get off the state’s F list. They could lure good teachers and ensure that no student ever experienced the embarrassment he had. All Holmes County had to do, Henderson said, was build a new high school. A teenager loaded a slide that showed a confusing graph of numbers. The slide, Henderson explained, showed an estimate of what the bond would cost taxpayers. Homeowners would pay somewhere between $33 and $112 in extra property taxes each year, plus another $67 annual fee if they owned a car. Business owners would contribute more, and farmers would, too, though Henderson hadn’t listed how much the bond would cost people who owned land. The crowd grumbled. The school Henderson wanted wouldn’t just have a science lab and a working HVAC system. It had a swimming pool, a football field and a theater where students could put on plays. The crowd wanted the amenities, but most believed they could not afford them. Though many people in the audience owned farmland, the per capita income in Holmes County was just $14,000 a year. Even a few hundred dollars felt like a stretch. What if they couldn’t afford to keep their land? The county clerk, Earline Wright-Hart, strode to the front and grabbed the microphone. For years, she explained, businesses had been leaving Holmes. The county’s population had declined by 19 percent over the last two decades, to 17,000 from 21,000. A dollar store had filed for bankruptcy that week, and Wright-Hart didn’t expect a new shop to replace it. The few businessmen who expressed interest in opening a law practice or a medical clinic always changed their minds once they saw the schools. “I get so sick of being asked, ‘Why y’all got them dilapidated schools?’” Wright-Hart said. “No economic development is going to come here, no factory is going to come here.” A new school would inspire businesses to open, Wright-Hart told the crowd. It would reinvigorate the tax base, and it might persuade the white families who had abandoned the public schools to return. Though Holmes was 15 percent white, all but a handful of the county’s white students attended a private school that segregationists opened half a century earlier on Robert E. Lee Drive, depriving the public schools of the $5,522-per-pupil funding the state would have sent the district. Several people spoke at once. Of course they wanted businesses and jobs, they said. Half the county spent an hour driving south to break down chickens or work the assembly line at Nissan. And they wanted white families to choose the public schools over the private one. “But it ain’t going to happen,” a woman called out. Henderson stepped back, quiet as the crowd murmured its agreement. He knew the woman was right. But Holmes did not have to wait for outside saviors, Henderson believed. If the community pooled its meager resources, maybe that would be enough for its kids. Harvey Ellington longed for the future Henderson envisioned. He told the superintendent he wanted to study biotechnology at Xavier University of Louisiana, a small Catholic school in New Orleans. Xavier, a historically Black college, has in recent years graduated more Black students with degrees in biology and physics than any other institution in the country, and Ellington liked to imagine himself among their prestigious ranks. He worried, though, that Holmes would hold him back the way it once had Henderson. What if Xavier’s admissions counselors discovered he attended an F-rated school with no science lab? What if he made it to college, only to find himself hopelessly behind? He was only 15, too young to vote, but he wanted the lab Henderson had promised, so the teenager traveled the county with the superintendent in fall 2019, passing out buttons and asking his neighbors to pay for a new school. Ellington knew that kids in other parts of the state learned in nicer buildings. He heard about a school near Jackson with an elevator and a college-size football stadium, and he knew that voters in Madison had approved their own $61 million bond a decade earlier, in part to build a high school. Holmes had even lost one of its best science teachers, LeShundra Young, to Madison. Young grew up in Holmes County and returned after graduate school because she wanted to help her community — the epitome of “grow your own.” But she became frustrated trying to teach with few books and no supplies. One year, her class had to use wire hangers to make test-tube clamps for an advanced-placement biology experiment. Young didn’t want her own children to learn in those conditions, so she left. Soon after that she transferred to Madison, to a school with six labs and real, functioning equipment, Young won the national presidential award for excellence in math and science teaching. “It literally hurt my heart to leave those kids, but I had to,” Young told me. “It was not the children. If I could have brought them with me, I would have. It was the lack of resources. You have to have something. If you’re already in a town that struggles the way it does, in a county that struggles the way it does, there has to be something to attract people to want to work there. And a building is just a building, but it’s a start.” Holmes rejected a bond a few years before Henderson arrived, leaving district leaders to spend what money they did have on maintenance, not actual improvements. While wealthier districts were buying interactive whiteboards and the kind of science equipment Young left to find in Madison, Holmes was spending its budget on plumbers, roofers and temporary fixes to make the schools inhabitable. School bonds are especially hard to pass in Mississippi because the state decided in the 1950s to begin requiring counties to win at least 60 percent approval. (Fewer than 10 states have requirements as strict as Mississippi’s.) In the 1980s and 1990s, Black residents sued the state in federal court, arguing that the supermajority rule particularly harmed Black students who attend school in communities where most of the white students attend private academies. Before desegregation, when the public schools were still majority white, most school bonds passed, the plaintiffs noted. That changed after white students abandoned the public system. Though Black voters continued to support school-bond measures at a rate of more than 70 percent, few districts had successfully passed a bond since desegregation. A district court judge dismissed the complaint, arguing that the plaintiffs hadn’t proven that the law was racist. “It is a fact that whites own the majority of owner-occupied property (approximately 80 percent of value of all such property statewide), and thus may be less inclined to vote ‘yes’ to increase their property taxes,” the judge wrote. “But that does not provide a basis for concluding that ‘race’ is the reason for their voting behavior and suggests, instead, that self-interest may be the reason.” The week Henderson announced his campaign, another rural, majority-Black county in the state tried and failed to pass a bond. Fifty-eight percent of voters agreed to finance an $8.75 million bond in the Leland School District, but it wasn’t enough. Henderson never let himself doubt his district’s chances, but as the vote drew near, he started to hear things. A white woman called the radio station, offering to pay a Black person to record an ad against the bond. And one day, while Henderson was eating at the restaurant that his sister owned, a white man told a Black woman he wouldn’t support “that bond for a colored school.” On Election Day, Henderson didn’t spot a single white person as he drove along Lexington’s busiest streets. The county’s Black residents, however, were everywhere. The bond was just one of a dozen lines on the ballot, and African Americans set up big parties outside polling stations. At home, Henderson spent hours telling the bus drivers and school-board members who called that he felt good about the district’s chances. He had won over key detractors in Durant. Dozens of people in Tchula, the county’s poorest town, had texted, promising their support. And a volunteer football coach had even released two R.&B. songs endorsing the bond, catchy tunes teenagers had been singing in the high school halls. But when the county clerk finished counting that night, she told Henderson that he’d won 55 percent — a majority, but not a win. Reporters at a Jackson-based news channel thought that the margin meant the bond had passed, and Holmes residents kept sending Henderson screenshots of their TVs, showing the green check of victory. “No,” Henderson replied to each. It didn’t matter that more than half of Holmes voters had agreed to raise their taxes. “We needed 60 percent.” Eventually, Henderson’s phone buzzed with a message from Ellington: “We got it?” Henderson swallowed hard, wiped his eyes, then hit reply. “No, son,” he typed. “We did not.” Ellington seemed adrift after the vote. His drama teacher left the first week of the spring semester, and Henderson couldn’t find anyone to replace him, so Ellington spent the 80-minute class in the gym, watching wrestling on his phone and Googling pictures of England, imagining himself anywhere but Holmes. In January, a few days after he turned 16, Ellington signed up to serve as the vice president for a new Black male mentorship club. The teenager skipped part of biology to attend the first meeting, but no one else showed, not even the president of the club, so Ellington waited in silence with an art teacher. Eventually, frustrated that he was missing his favorite class for what appeared to be no reason, Ellington pulled out a notebook and drafted a list of questions he hoped someone might answer. • How can we raise money to improve our school funding? • How can we get teachers to teach courses we don’t have here at Holmes County Central high school? • What do we need to do to get more certified teachers? Henderson still believed the district would never reach its potential without new buildings, but the system remained in danger of a state takeover, so in early 2020, he sent out a newsletter, warning residents that if they didn’t band together, they would lose control of the schools. “The state of Mississippi cannot have our district!” he wrote. “We must own it.” Over the last two decades, Mississippi had taken control of more than 20 districts it deemed to be in crisis — including, briefly, Holmes County in 2006. In 2016, the state introduced a new program to take over districts that repeatedly fail to meet academic standards. Under that model, the state dissolves the local board, fires the superintendent, then absorbs the failing districts into what officials call the Achievement School District. Other states have tried to improve schools this way but have not succeeded. In Tennessee, where officials won $49 million from Obama’s Race to the Top contest to design their Achievement School District, researchers found that schools in the turnaround program did not improve after six years. And when Michigan abandoned its program in 2017, six years after it began, two-thirds of the 15 schools the state took over remained in the bottom 5 percent of the state’s rankings. Researchers have only begun to identify the reasons state-run districts fail, but a few trends have emerged: State takeovers tend to target districts whose students are largely poor and Black, and most efforts have not addressed the ways racism and poverty have set those children behind. Instead, takeovers rely on the idea that school failure is largely a problem of governance, and so, rather than doing the hard work of fixing the root causes, states simply send in new leaders. State takeovers also haven’t fixed teacher shortages. Though Michigan and Tennessee recruited young people through Teach for America, researchers found that both state-run districts suffered from high turnover rates. Mississippi began its Achievement District takeovers in the fall of 2019 with Yazoo City and Humphreys, two rural, majority-Black communities that border Holmes. Officials had considered including Holmes in its first round, but after the consolidation, they agreed to give the combined district a chance. No one in Holmes seemed to view the reprieve as permanent. The district’s overall ranking had declined since the consolidation, and the high school, which earned a D and a 555 on the 1,000-point scale in 2018, slipped more than 100 points to an F in 2019. Only 10 percent of the high school’s 800 students passed the reading test, and just 3 percent were proficient in math. Residents talked about the takeover as if it were a lurking evil. If it happened, the community would lose its school board, and thus its say in how its schools were run. Anthony Anderson, a minister who served as the school-board president, told me that he felt as if he were “looking down the barrel of a gun. You know the next bullet coming out is going to be a takeover bullet.” That January, Henderson introduced an initiative he believed would lift the high school’s score. Administrators called it “Power Hour.” School leaders identified 100 students they believed had the greatest ability to improve their state test scores. Some were failing; others had passed but needed one or two additional correct answers to earn a higher grade. Teachers then signed those kids up for extra tutoring. Researchers at the University of North Carolina and Columbia University have panned this method, which they call “educational triage,” because it neglects the highest- and lowest-performing students, but Henderson was willing to try. The first tutoring session began at 9 a.m. An administrator sang off-key into the intercom, extolling the program’s virtues, but in the hallways, a few teachers rolled their eyes. Henderson hadn’t hired any additional instructors, so teachers had to give up their planning periods to staff the sessions. When the bell rang, a social-studies teacher passed out a quiz to six students. The test was supposed to assess their knowledge of World War II and the Harlem Renaissance, but the teenagers seemed distracted. It was raining. The rooms were musty, and the hallway outside had a thin layer of water covering the linoleum. The Power Hour kids could hear their classmates, laughing and splashing down the halls. By midmorning, both the high school and the middle school were starting to flood. On his way to lunch, Ellington passed a woman who told him she was a new substitute English teacher. “Nice to meet you,” Ellington said. “How would you feel if we could get a new school and school funds and new businesses here?” The teacher laughed. “I would love that. Y’all definitely need a new school, especially with what’s going on in the bathrooms.” “The bathroom’s still not working?” Ellington asked. “That’s against the law to have us here.” Bathrooms had broken down the week before after a clay pipe deteriorated. Maintenance crews had replaced the pipe, but now, the teacher explained to Ellington, as the rain overwhelmed the building’s plumbing, several toilets had stopped functioning again. By 12:30 p.m., the high school’s water fountains were running brown, and every bathroom at the middle school had stopped working, too, so Henderson decided to close both schools for the day. A bell rang, and Ellington ambled into the wet hallways. Water splashed against his khakis, and other boys yelled and pushed their way to the front of the school. When Ellington made it out, he searched for his bus, but he didn’t see it. Eventually, after the teenagers milled around the parking lot for half an hour, the principal came through screaming. The district didn’t have enough buses to release both the middle and high school students at once, he explained. “Move back to your A-block class now,” the principal shouted. “Move. Let’s go.” Ellington headed inside, but when he reached his classroom, no other students were there. All spring, Ellington texted complaints to Henderson. His algebra class didn’t have textbooks, so he spent half the period copying equations onto loose sheets of paper. The instructor tried to augment their lessons with online homework from Khan Academy, a nonprofit that offers free video tutorials, but Ellington didn’t have a computer or internet access at home, and he couldn’t figure out how to do the lesson on his phone, so he didn’t complete it. When the teacher scolded him, Ellington felt so embarrassed, he argued with her until she sent him to the principal’s office. A few nights before spring break, Henderson saw Ellington at a round-table meeting, and he could see how crushed the teenager felt. He wasn’t getting a science lab. He couldn’t do his homework. Even part of the school day was a waste. “I just want out of Holmes County,” Ellington told him. Henderson didn’t know how long it would take him to help Ellington. He might not find a drama teacher before the end of the semester, and the district probably wouldn’t build a new school before Ellington graduated, but Henderson promised the second half of the spring semester would be better. Two weeks later, the coronavirus reached Mississippi. Henderson knew that internet access was spotty in Holmes, but he had no idea how bad it was: When he surveyed the district’s families, he found that more than 75 percent of his students had no way to get online. Many teachers didn’t, either. Like all impoverished school districts, Holmes receives federal money under a program called Title I. In a normal year, Holmes officials spend the extra $1,000 or so per student on tutors and teachers’ aides, but after the pandemic shuttered schools, Henderson reallocated some of those dollars to buy Chromebooks. By the end of March, he had passed out 1,300 tablets. He also turned six school buses into roving hot spots, but the infrastructure didn’t reach every family. The district had 3,000 students. Some families said they had several children competing to use one Chromebook, and each school bus hot spot broadcast only 100 feet, leaving much of the county without access. While Ellington waited for his own Chromebook, he spent his days playing an Xbox wrestling game with his brothers and reading “The Hate U Give” and “The Mis-Education of the Negro.” He finally got a computer and a hot spot in mid-April, but none of Ellington’s teachers were doing live lessons. Instead, they told him to log onto Edgenuity, an online platform that offers prerecorded assignments. Henderson used federal CARES dollars to buy more laptops and hot spots, and he kept school bus drivers employed by hiring them to deliver meals to students twice a day. The Guardian and ABC News covered his efforts, and people from as far away as Seattle and Minneapolis sent donations, but around Holmes, people took to Facebook to air their skepticism of him. Some had grown frustrated with Henderson during the school-bond campaign, and others resented him for demoting and firing their relatives. Two years into his tenure, the community no longer seemed to believe that Henderson could be their savior. A block of board members began shooting down every proposal he made. And in May, one resident sent Henderson a Facebook message, promising to have him assassinated so the district could get a new superintendent. The message paralyzed Henderson. He spent his weekdays driving deserted roads in a Crown Victoria everyone knew was his. Someone could shoot him and never get caught. “My kids, my biological kids, could be fatherless,” he told me, “because I believed in a place like Holmes County.” In July, two weeks before the 2020 fall semester, Henderson bought four fishing poles. He picked up Ellington and his brothers, then he drove them to a pond on his family’s land. Ellington looked around, wide-eyed, as they pulled up. Henderson’s farm was vast and green, and Ellington felt free in all that space. They walked up to the water, cast their lines in hopes of luring brim or white perch, then Henderson told Ellington he needed to tell him something important. “I’m leaving,” he said. He’d found a new job in Chicago, overseeing a district of urban high schools just a few miles from his oldest daughter’s home. Ellington could feel his face fall. His stomach hurt, and his heart did, too. “I had a dream about this,” he told Henderson. “I knew you were going to do this.” Henderson and Ellington cast their lines again, and they waited. Ellington tried to be patient. They fished for two hours, and eventually, they reeled in their empty lines. The district employed two interim superintendents during the pandemic. A state audit later found that half the students in some schools never logged on to their virtual classes. Some teachers didn’t, either. Ellington tried to pay attention. The hot spot the district gave him worked well enough, as long as it wasn’t raining, but he found it hard to concentrate when he was taking care of his brothers. His English teacher never showed up on Zoom, and in November, Ellington learned on Facebook that the 25-year-old woman had died after contracting the coronavirus. Ellington was supposed to join a different English class, but no one told him how to log in, and when his grades for his nine-week report card came back, he discovered he’d failed. The district’s leaders didn’t find a new English teacher until February. Ellington spent his nights and weekends doing the makeup work the new teacher assigned, but he ended the school year with a D in English. He earned Bs in his other classes, and he won student of the month three times his junior year, but he worried the English grade and his low A.C.T. score would keep him from qualifying for college scholarships. He realized during the pandemic that he couldn’t afford Xavier, but he hoped to earn enough money to enroll at Jackson State, the historically Black university Henderson attended. He had abandoned biology too, in favor of geography, a major that would allow him to see the world, if only through textbooks. As his junior year came to a close, Ellington started to feel hopeful again. Soon, he would return to in-person learning. He could start fresh with a new superintendent. When he sent the email to Debra Powell, he really believed he had a plan to improve his school. Powell didn’t respond for nearly two months. (She told me she inherited a mess and was busy prioritizing finding teachers.) When she replied in mid-July, she didn’t mention any of Ellington’s suggestions. Instead she told Ellington she’d decided to go “in a new direction” to give other students a chance to lead. Ellington was hurt and confused, but he decided to ask his principal if there were other opportunities to help. The principal said he would meet with the teenager, but a week later, the state accreditation board released a 372-page audit showing that since the consolidation, the district had violated 81 percent of the state’s process standards. Holmes County, the audit suggested, might have reached a state of emergency. In early August, a few days before the start of Ellington’s senior year, the accreditation board and the state school board each met to decide the school district’s fate. Both meetings lasted more than four hours, and in them, state employees explained that the audit had uncovered some stark revelations. Henderson, the interim superintendents and the school board had failed to provide “effective educational leadership,” auditors found. The district was financially unstable. Durant still didn’t have social-studies textbooks for half its students, and the school didn’t have science books for Grades K through 4. Two other elementary schools, Goodman-Pickens and S.V. Marshall, were using “various websites” to teach science — a method that had left Holmes with the lowest science proficiency in the state. The high school stored its textbooks — most of which were out of date and in poor condition — in a utility closet next to mops, buckets and cleaning solutions. During the pandemic, auditors found, the school’s math and social studies teachers provided no instruction at all. (Ellington disputed this finding: He wasn’t sure how other classes fared, but his geometry teacher taught every virtual class, he said.) Though the temperature hovered above 90 degrees in early August, most of the district’s schools didn’t have air-conditioning or the kind of upgraded ventilation equipment other districts had installed while students were learning at home. The board had only recently agreed to buy new HVAC systems — too late to install them before school started. Nearly a third of the district’s buses were out of service, and the rest had “significant” issues like inoperable brakes and turn signals and broken emergency doors and windows. The county still didn’t have enough qualified teachers. More than 60 percent either didn’t have a license or were teaching outside their subject area. “This district has been failing these kids from kindergarten all the way through graduation,” a lawyer for the state testified. The Mississippi Board of Education agreed. Two days before the new school year, the board conceded that the consolidated district the state had created had reached a state of emergency. Mississippi would take over Holmes. The local school board would be dissolved, and Debra Powell would lose the job she had just started. A new interim superintendent would replace her. It’s unclear whether the intervention will help. Since 2015, Mississippi has declared a state of emergency and taken over two other districts. One, a rural and majority-Black school district two hours north of Holmes, improved from a D to a C, but the other, a rural and majority-Black district two hours east of Holmes, remains an F. On the most recent state exams, students there scored lower than Holmes in both math and history. Though many Holmes students went a year without learning, the pandemic may offer an unlikely opportunity for growth: Mississippi received more than $2.5 billion in federal relief to spend on its schools by September 2024. Holmes will get $29 million of it. The timeline for spending may be too short to build a new school, and the district can’t use the money to pay teachers’ recurring salaries, but it can use the federal relief to pay for technology, professional development and after-school programs. When the school bus bumped down Ellington’s road in early August, he tried to remain optimistic. He had signed up for U.S. government and human anatomy, and he hoped to pull his G.P.A. up from a 3.4 to a 3.9. By the end of his second day, though, he started to worry that the state takeover had done little to change his circumstances. One of his classes didn’t have textbooks, and two others lacked teachers. Soon, he was spending half of most days in the gym with dozens of other kids, waiting without air-conditioning or instruction. Ellington’s mom told him once that the district was in disrepair when she graduated in 1997. Henderson had experienced the same. Whole generations of Holmes students had suffered the way Ellington had, and it pained the boy to think his brothers might inherit the same broken system. Sitting in the gym, sweating through his school uniform, Ellington told himself to hold on to the bit of hope he had left. The new superintendent hadn’t arrived yet. He wanted to believe that she could fix things, but he knew the work was too much for one person to do alone, and nine months hardly seemed long enough to make up for what he’d lost. His brothers were still young, though. Maybe, he thought, there would be time enough for them.

2021-10-02,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/24/business/reparations-wealth-gap.html," The wealth gap between Black and white Americans is too enormous to be remedied through incremental programs. What’s needed are federal reparations. The reason is essentially twofold: The sheer size of the wealth gap requires massive federal intervention to close it, and justice requires that the U.S. government fulfill its unmet obligations to African American slaves and their descendants. I’ve written in a previous column about the colossal size of the wealth gap. Briefly, estimates from the Federal Reserve’s 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances indicate that the average Black household had $840,900 less in net worth than the average white household. Black American descendants of people enslaved in the United States constitute 12 percent of the nation’s population but possess less than 2 percent of the nation’s wealth. A reparations plan for African Americans would be aimed at bringing the share of Black wealth into consistency with the share of the population. Simple arithmetic shows that this would require at least $11 trillion. International norms suggest that reparations should primarily take the form of direct payments. Examples include Germany’s payments of restitution to the victims of the Holocaust, the U.S. government’s payments to Japanese Americans who were subjected to mass incarceration during World War II, as well as U.S. government payments to families that lost loved ones in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. But reparations need not be cash transfers. They could take less liquid forms, like trust accounts or annuities. In our book, “From Here to Equality,” my wife, Kirsten Mullen, and I suggest that reparations should go to Black American descendants of people enslaved in the United States, including those emancipated at the close of the Civil War and promised 40-acre land grants as restitution for bondage. That promise has never been met. Coupled with the government’s provision of 160-acre land grants to 1.5 million white families under the Homestead Act of 1862, the denial of restitution to African Americans after the Civil War marked the start of a cumulative, intergenerational process resulting in today’s mammoth racial wealth gap. The federal government’s culpability extends well beyond those actions, my research and that of many other scholars show. By failing to take action to stop or bring to justice the perpetrators of these offenses, the government effectively sanctioned more than 100 well-documented white terrorist massacres from the end of the Civil War through World War II. Recent attention has been called to the atrocities that occurred in Wilmington, N.C., in 1898 and in Tulsa, Okla., in 1921. But there were many more. In 1919, known as the “Red Summer,” about 35 massacres occurred in locales as varied as Bisbee, Ariz.; Chicago; Wilmington, Del.; Elaine, Ark.; Washington, D.C.; and Ocoee, Fla. Black lives were lost to white mob violence, and white terrorists seized and appropriated — stole — Black property. All this deepened the racial wealth divide. Furthermore, in the 20th century, the federal government promoted homeownership in a harshly discriminatory manner that benefited white households and sidelined African Americans. For example, the Federal Housing Administration excluded Black Americans from programs that granted white applicants access to easy credit for home buying. And while the G.I. Bill aided veterans returning from World War II in home buying and business development, these provisions were applied unevenly, often to the detriment of Black people. In short, the federal government fostered white asset ownership and helped build the racial divide in wealth. The federal government is not only culpable; it is the only government entity capable of meeting the reparations debt. All state and municipal annual budgets combined amount to less than $3.5 trillion. If they were even to attempt to meet a bill of more than $11 trillion collectively, they would have to devote all of their financial resources to reparations for four consecutive years, disabling their ability to provide any services to their constituents. The federal government’s response to the 2007-9 Great Recession and to the current pandemic demonstrate that it can rapidly mobilize resources and spend huge sums without raising taxes. Federal expenditures to mitigate the economic impact of Covid-19 now exceed $6 trillion. The resources for reparations can be mustered. But progress so far has been scant. Proposed congressional legislation to establish a commission on African American reparations does not provide assurance that redress would be forthcoming. Among its flaws, the bill, H.R. 40/S. 40, includes no directives that might guide a commission or ensure that it produces a reparations plan capable of eradicating the gulf in wealth. As a practical matter, our book outlines two criteria that could be used to establish eligibility for receipt of reparations. First, the government could impose a lineage standard: An individual would need to have at least one ancestor who was enslaved in the United States. Second, there is a need for an identity standard: Reparations recipients would need to show that, for at least 12 years before the enactment of a reparations plan or establishment of a study commission for reparations, they had self-identified as Black, Negro, African American or Afro-American. This criterion would prevent someone who is living as white from suddenly claiming eligibility for reparations when there is a monetary gain to be had from being the descendant of an enslaved person. Congress would need to authorize the Treasury and the Federal Reserve to make the payments. Reparations may be summarized as a program of acknowledgment, redress and closure for grievous injustices. Acknowledgment is a culpable party’s admission that it has committed a horrendous wrong, accompanied by a promise to make restitution. Redress is the act of restitution, involving direct compensatory payments to members of a victimized community. Closure is mutual recognition by the culpable party and the victimized community that redress is sufficient and that the account is settled. The U.S. government has begun the first step, the act of acknowledgment. On July 29, 2008, the House of Representatives declared that the government “apologizes to African Americans on behalf of the people of the United States, for the wrongs committed against them and their ancestors who suffered under slavery and Jim Crow.” The Senate issued a statement with identical language on June 18, 2009. However, while the House resolution expressed a “commitment to rectify the lingering consequences of the misdeeds committed against African Americans under slavery and Jim Crow and to stop the occurrence of human rights violations in the future,” the Senate was far more cautious. It said that “nothing in this resolution authorizes, supports or serves as a settlement of any claim against the United States.” Clearly, then, the United States has not come close to providing restitution and is far from achieving closure. Reparations for Black American descendants of enslaved people in the United States are already more than 155 years overdue. The federal government’s own policies helped to create the racial wealth divide, and it has a responsibility to provide restitution. William A. Darity Jr. is a professor of economics and the Samuel DuBois Cook distinguished professor of public policy at Duke. He and Kirsten Mullen are the authors of “From Here to Equality: Reparations for Black Americans in the Twenty-First Century” (UNC Press, 2020).",10,2021,2021_q4
2021-10-02,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/01/business/credit-score-app-cost.html," Despite the popularity of mobile apps promising easy access to credit information, obtaining free, bona fide credit scores remains a challenge for consumers, according to a new analysis. Consumer Reports, which published an analysis of five popular credit apps on Thursday, found that some of the digital tools may provide credit scores that differ from the ones a lender would consider, limiting their usefulness. In addition, Consumer Reports said, some apps charge for the scores, and some also charge users for bundles that include their credit reports — even though consumers are legally entitled to receive their reports annually, at no cost, on a special website. (During the pandemic, the three major credit bureaus — TransUnion, Experian and Equifax — have been offering consumers free weekly access to their reports.) Credit reports are records of your loan and payment history, maintained by the three bureaus. Credit scores are three-digit numbers based on the credit reports and calculated using various formulas developed by companies like FICO and VantageScore. The scores range from 300 to 850, with 670 or above considered good. The average FICO score is 716. Lenders use the scores to determine if you’re likely to repay a debt and what interest rate to charge you. Consumers aren’t currently entitled to free credit scores, except in certain situations. The new analysis highlights the drawbacks of the current credit system, said Syed Ejaz, financial policy analyst for Consumer Reports. Credit scores affect a person’s ability to buy a house or a car, or even to get a job or rent an apartment — but it’s hard to know just what your score is without paying for it. “These are superconsequential decisions in a consumer’s financial life,” Mr. Ejaz said. “Consumers should be shown these scores for free.” John Ulzheimer, a credit industry expert, said a score from a credit app was unlikely to be the exact one you would receive from a lender, since there are multiple versions of credit scores depending on the credit bureau providing them and the software version used. But even a general score can put you in the ballpark of what type of score to expect from a lender, he said. “It will give you an idea of what your score would be,” Mr. Ulzheimer said, so can be helpful, particularly if it is free. A Consumer Financial Protection Bureau study in 2012 found that most consumers who scored well under one scoring model generally scored well on other models. But a “substantial minority” could see large variations, it said, so consumers “should avoid relying on scores they purchase as the sole basis for assessing their creditworthiness when making important decisions about obtaining credit.” The Consumer Reports review examined the five most popular credit scoring apps according to download data. In addition to apps offered by Experian and TransUnion, the report considered apps from Credit Karma, Credit Sesame, and myFICO. (An offering from Equifax didn’t meet the study criteria, Consumer Reports said.) Researchers downloaded the apps early this year, and rechecked them in the spring. The myFICO app provided broad access to industry-specific credit scores, like scores used for credit cards and car loans. The app is offered by the Fair Isaac Corporation, which developed the FICO score. The company says there are multiple versions of FICO scores, which it says are used in “90 percent” of lending decisions. But myFICO charges fees for its scores, starting at $19.95 a month for a “basic” package that includes multiple scores and an Experian credit report. A “premier” package, including monthly FICO scores and reports from all three bureaus, is about $40 a month. Greg Jawski, a FICO spokesman, said the myFICO app offered features like customized information and simulations to help users better understand their score. FICO also offers an “open access” program, which lets lenders share with consumers, for free, the scores they use in credit decisions. The other apps vary in what they charge. Credit Karma doesn’t charge for scores or reports. Credit Sesame, which also offers VantageScore, doesn’t charge for scores but does charge for a package that includes credit reports from all three bureaus. Experian offers a basic FICO score and an Experian credit report at no cost, but charges for an expanded package that includes, among other things, additional scores and reports from the other credit bureaus. TransUnion said its Score & Report app charges about $20 a month for daily access to a TransUnion VantageScore and credit report, plus other information. VantageScore, a lesser-known competitor to FICO, is a joint venture of the three big credit bureaus. Its use has been growing, according to a consultant’s report prepared for the company. But it’s generally not used for home loan applications, because federally backed mortgages are required to use FICO scores. Credit Sesame said in an email that it believed VantageScore was a “more inclusive” scoring model, generating scores for some 40 million consumers deemed “unscoreable” by other models because they are new to credit or have a limited credit history. Adrian Nazari, chief executive of Credit Sesame, said that its users mostly wanted to understand and improve their credit scores, and that VantageScore was a “great educational tool.” He added, “We offer so much more than a score.” The overall result, Mr. Ejaz said, is a sometimes confusing mix of offerings that may not provide what consumers expect, and often come with sales pitches for loans and credit cards. The apps may also raise privacy concerns, since they collect “substantial” private consumer data, the report found. Here are some questions and answers about credit scores: Regardless of the scoring model used, there are steps you can take to improve your score. These include paying your bills on time, keeping your card balances low in relation to your overall credit limit and limiting the number of loans and credit cards you have open. Proposals in Congress, including H.R. 4120, the Comprehensive Credit Act of 2021, would provide free access to the credit scores that lenders use. In some cases, yes. Cards issued by big banks and American Express often offer holders access to free credit scores online. Discover Card, for instance, says it offers free monthly FICO scores from Experian. But here again, the scores may not always reflect specific scores that a lender would use, depending on the type of loan you are seeking. Check with your bank or card issuer for details. Chi Chi Wu, a lawyer with the National Consumer Law Center, said getting a free score from your lender or credit card company was “definitely preferable” to paying for one from an app. It’s free, she said, and because you’re already a customer, you’re not divulging any more personal information than you already provided to get the card.",10,2021,2021_q4
2021-10-02,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/business/imf-world-bank-kristalina-georgieva.html," WASHINGTON — In remarks to staff on Friday, Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, denied allegations that she pressured staff to manipulate a report to placate China when she was a top World Bank official and said she cares deeply about the integrity of data and analysis, according to people familiar with the meeting. “I disagree with the implications for my role, and let me put it very simply to you: Not true,” she said, according to a transcript of her remarks. A day earlier, an internal World Bank investigation concluded that Ms. Georgieva was among a group of senior World Bank officials who pressured the team that conducts the annual Doing Business survey to inflate China’s standing in its 2018 report. The findings have raised questions about Ms. Georgieva, who was the World Bank’s chief executive at the time, and have led to a review by the ethics committee of the I.M.F. The meeting on Friday, which was held mostly virtually, had been previously scheduled to prepare the staff of the I.M.F. for its annual meeting held jointly with the World Bank. Ms. Georgieva addressed the controversy at the outset of the meeting, reiterating her public statement that she “fundamentally disagrees” with the characterizations in the report and insisting that the inquiry would not be a distraction. She did not litigate the details of the allegations, but she said that asking staff to double-check something was not the same as pressuring it to change data, methodology or an outcome. “Neither in this case nor before or after have I put pressure on staff to manipulate data. I would ask staff to please check, double-check, triple-check, but never change, never manipulate what the data tells us,” she said. “Why? Because I believe so strongly in the value of credible data and analysis that leads to policy recommendations for the benefit of our members. For the benefit of people.” Ms. Georgieva expressed remorse that the inquiry had caused an uproar, but she insisted that it would not be a distraction. “It is my responsibility that this does not interfere with the incredibly important work we do,” she said. “So let’s focus on that work, and that is what the focus of the discussion we will have today is all about.” According to the World Bank investigation, which was conducted by the law firm WilmerHale at the request of the bank’s ethics committee, officials in 2017 were concerned about negotiations with members over a capital increase and were under pressure not to anger China, which was ranked 78th on the list of countries that year and was set to decline in the 2018 report. The investigation found that Ms. Georgieva was “directly involved” with efforts to improve China’s ranking. At one point, according to the report, Ms. Georgieva chastised the bank’s China director for mismanaging the bank’s relationship with the country. On Thursday, the World Bank said it was ending its annual Doing Business survey. The report has been used for years by developing countries to lure foreign investment and by international investors making decisions about which markets to explore. In an email to staff on Friday evening, David Malpass, the World Bank president, said he was “deeply disappointed” by what had happened under the watch of his predecessors and pledged to foster a healthier culture at the institution. “It was troubling that many staff felt that raising concerns would have negative consequences for their well-being and their career,” Mr. Malpass said. “Intimidation, retaliation and bullying are unacceptable, and I’m committed to protecting against such behavior wherever we find it.” The politicization of the survey is an indication of how China’s economic might is influencing multilateral institutions and the lengths that they will go to curry favor with the Chinese government. If China disengages in protest, institutions such as the World Bank lose credibility. “China is clearly eager to control the international narrative about its economy and its government’s policy choices,” said Eswar Prasad, the former China director of the I.M.F. Republican lawmakers, who have been critical of the I.M.F. for allocating emergency currency reserves to American adversaries, called for an additional investigation into what transpired at the World Bank. “As the World Bank’s largest shareholder, the U.S. must demand accountability,” Senator Bill Hagerty, Republican of Tennessee, said on Twitter on Friday. “Multilateralism cannot mean just doing whatever is necessary to get more money from Communist China.” Representative Andy Barr of Kentucky, the top Republican on the House Financial Services subcommittee that oversees international development, said the Treasury Department should look into how the I.M.F. aided China under Ms. Georgieva’s watch. He pointed to $650 billion of currency reserves, known as special drawing rights, that the fund disbursed last month, which Republicans have said should not have been given to countries such as China, Russia and Iran. “Given Ms. Georgieva’s leadership of the I.M.F., Treasury should evaluate her actions in the run-up to the I.M.F.’s earlier approval of an S.D.R. allocation, her advocacy for new trust fund assistance involving China, and her ongoing work surrounding the I.M.F.’s governance review, which has implications for China’s influence at the fund,” Mr. Barr said. The Treasury Department, which serves as America’s liaison to the I.M.F. and has significant voting power, expressed concern over the allegations and said it was analyzing the findings of the investigation.",10,2021,2021_q4
2021-10-02,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/30/sports/soccer/fifa-us-move.html," Looking to expand its global footprint beyond its cloistered headquarters next to a zoo on the outskirts of Zurich, soccer’s governing body, FIFA, is studying the feasibility of moving its financial engine, the commercial operation that produces billions of dollars in revenues for the organization, to the United States. The possible move will be determined by technical factors including the suitability of locations on both coasts, the ease of acquiring work visas for overseas staff members and tax rules, according to an official with direct knowledge of the discussions who declined to speak publicly because a final determination had yet to be made. The operations involved represent a vital part of FIFA’s business: They oversee FIFA’s sale of sponsorships and broadcasting rights, which represent some of the most lucrative properties in global sports. Since the election of Gianni Infantino as its president in 2016, FIFA been looking at extending its footprint beyond its glass-and-steel headquarters on the east side of Zurich. It has already opened an office in Paris, where most of its staff involved in development and relations with its 211 member associations will eventually be based. Officials are hopeful that relocating its commercial business to a major American city would help FIFA attract and retain key staff members, amid concerns that its current home is proving a hurdle in attracting talent. Local regulations require FIFA to employ a fixed number of Swiss staff members. FIFA’s interest in decoupling itself from Zurich is also — in part — an effort to improve its reputation and loosen its ties with its troubled recent past in Switzerland, the country that has been its home since 1932. Several members of FIFA’s executive board were arrested in Zurich in 2015 as part of a sprawling United States Department of Justice investigation that revealed corrupt practices dating back at least two decades. That scandal led to the downfall of FIFA’s longtime president, Sepp Blatter, and most of the organization’s top leadership. A move to the United States would have been unthinkable for FIFA in the immediate aftermath of the arrests, since it might have put the organization’s officials, operations and financial accounts within the reach of the U.S. authorities. (Some former FIFA executives, possibly fearing arrest, have not set foot in North America since the scandal.) But now staying in Switzerland comes with its own issues. Infantino, who replaced Blatter as FIFA president a year after the raids, has faced a yearslong investigation into his relationship with Michael Lauber, Switzerland’s former attorney general. Lauber, who was forced out after revelations that he held private meetings with Infantino, was responsible for Swiss investigations stemming from the 2015 American indictment. Those inquiries have yielded few charges. The failure of the Swiss authorities to act in the corruption case has frustrated elements of FIFA’s current leadership, who have privately expressed incredulity at the inaction given the amount of evidence obtained in searches of FIFA’s headquarters. At the same time, the investigation into Infantino led to a furious response, with FIFA’s assistant secretary general branding it “a little grotesque and unfair.” FIFA’s effort to move parts of its operations away from Zurich is seen by insiders as necessary measures for an organization looking to move beyond working methods dating back several decades. The decision to relocate to Paris, for example, has offered officials in its development and member association departments easier access to Africa, a region over which FIFA has largely assumed complete control after a separate corruption scandal involving the president of the regional governing body on the continent. “Our aim of making football truly global also means that FIFA itself needs to have a more balanced and global organizational set up,” Infantino said when the Paris office opened in June. FIFA was established in Paris in 1904 but moved to Zurich in 1932 because of Switzerland’s location in the center of Europe, its political neutrality and because “it was accessible by train,” according to a timeline on FIFA’s website. In 2007, FIFA moved into its current headquarters building on a hill overlooking Zurich. The building, known as FIFA House, cost more than $200 million and has several subterranean levels, including the marble-floored, soundproof room where its governing council holds its meetings. Officials at FIFA remain undecided about how much of a presence the organization would keep in Switzerland, which — thanks to light-touch government oversight and friendly tax arrangements — has grown into the location of choice for international sporting federations. Lausanne, the home of the International Olympic Committee, actively recruits such organizations and has labeled itself “the Silicon Valley of sports.” Pushing for such significant changes is emblematic of FIFA under Infantino. A Swiss national, he has tried to institute major changes to the way both FIFA and soccer operate, with mixed results. He has enlarged the World Cup, an event responsible for more than 90 percent of FIFA’s revenues, to 48 teams from the current 32-nation format. But his efforts to force through other innovations and increase FIFA’s influence in club soccer have often fallen flat, and his current push to shift the World Cup from a quadrennial event to one staged every two years threatens a major fight with European soccer officials and even the International Olympic Committee. Moving to the United States would offer FIFA the chance to build out its commercial operation in a country that its officials feel has yet to embrace soccer at a level matching the sport’s place in other parts of the world. The timing would also allow FIFA to exert greater control over preparations for the 2026 World Cup, the first edition of the expanded tournament; that tournament will be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada. But being closer to Wall Street and major American companies, some top FIFA officials contend, would also offer the chance to significantly increase revenues as well as find partners to finance new events and invest in the growing popularity of women’s soccer. As well as tapping into the potential commercial opportunities available in the world’s largest economy, being based in the United States also would offer FIFA another chance to show that it has moved on from its scandal-ridden past. FIFA has in recent years tried to mend its relationship with the U.S. government, and officials have been in regular contact with the Department of Justice, which has continued its probe into corruption in world soccer. Some of the fruits of those improved ties were made clear last month when FIFA and its two regional confederations most implicated in the 2015 scandal were cleared to receive more than $200 million recovered from companies and individuals. The Justice Department said the money would have to be administered through FIFA.",10,2021,2021_q4
2021-10-02,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/05/books/review/on-freedom-maggie-nelson.html," ON FREEDOMFour Songs of Care and ConstraintBy Maggie Nelson “Freedom” is a very American rallying cry, but of the nearly four million Americans counted in the first U.S. census in 1790, one in six was a Black person in bondage. The concept of individual freedom, from the ancients to the American founders and beyond, is essentially negative: At its core is the idea of not being a slave. Maggie Nelson, in taking on this most American of topics in “On Freedom,” is always alert to the conceptual primacy of constraint, even as she allows herself no little freedom of her own. Readers of her previous work will anticipate the engagingly idiosyncratic way in which she draws on all of her lives: as poet, theorist, critic, mother, spouse. In “The Argonauts,” her 2015 exploration of many kinds of love — eros, parenting, friendship — she writes that she is sometimes “in drag as a memoirist,” and she remains, in this respect, en travesti. It’s fitting that “On Freedom” is dedicated to her son, Iggy, whose presence reminds us, as it has before in her writing (including, memorably, in the candid account of his birth in “The Argonauts”), that care both enables and constrains our freedom. Nelson originally came to this project, she says, because freedom had turned out to be “an unexpected subtext” in “The Art of Cruelty,” her 2011 book about the ethics and aesthetics of representing violence in the arts. Amid recent debates over campus no-platforming, campaigns to “decolonize the museum” and efforts to ban “critical race studies,” the questions about what may be represented, and who may do the representing, have grown in urgency. It would be good to have some sensible guidance as to how to think about them. Nelson’s new book provides such guidance. “It seems to me crucial — even ethically crucial — to treat with caution any rhetoric that purports to have all ethical goodness on its side,” she announces early on. She pays careful attention to those with whom she disagrees, judiciously accepting some of their points while firmly rejecting others. In her world, none of us, not even Maggie Nelson, has all ethical goodness on our side. Nelson promises only what she calls “weak theory,” which makes no claims to certainty and is “undisturbed by inconclusiveness and mess.” But weak theory can produce strong writing, not to mention vigorous analysis. Take her discussion of the controversy that erupted over Dana Schutz’s “Open Casket,” a painting of Emmett Till that was exhibited at the 2017 Whitney Biennial. Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books? This is a good place to start. For a number of artists and activists of color, the work was an affront. “The painting must go,” the Black British artist Hannah Black wrote in a Facebook post. At the core of her argument was the idea that because Schutz was white, “the subject matter” was not hers: Certain topics, Black suggested, should be closed to people of some identities because they belong to people of other identities. “White free speech and white creative freedom have been founded on the constraint of others,” she warned. Nelson, delving into the contretemps, notes that, historically, white audiences treated lynching as “spectacle and entertainment,” and so “this legacy of spectatorship inevitably traffics in ghastly business.” She dismisses the claim that curators should have “absolute freedom” to show what they choose: “Whenever someone starts talking about ‘absolute freedom,’ you know you’re in the presence of a straw man. No one on earth has absolute freedom to do much of anything.” She expresses sympathy for those who see white artists getting “space, attention and financial support” for work that may evince “a paltry or tone-deaf understanding of issues that others have spent their whole lives grappling with.” And then Nelson makes a characteristic turn. “I think one can say all this,” she writes, “without it following that such work is not art, unequivocally enacts harm, should be removed or should not exist.” Put aside the absolutist rhetoric, she urges. Instead, acknowledge that “expression needs context,” that “art is one such context, and its specificities matter.” With patience and equipoise, she helps us parse those specificities. Precisely because the context of art is complex, historically developing and contested, what she has to say can’t be reduced to a few rules or a simple formula. Invoking the category of “art,” she cautions, shouldn’t serve as an all-purpose alibi for awfulness. Yet she’s persuasive when she writes that the polemics against “Open Casket” rely on “distinctions — Black / white, men / not-men — that have difficulty bearing up under pressure (not to mention that their enactment would end up reifying the power of the very institutions the authors mean to challenge).” Nelson displays the same eloquent equipoise when she ventures into recent debates about the ethics and politics of sex. Here the issue is not just what we should be free to represent but what we should be free to do. She quotes Laura Kipnis, who, in her 2017 book “Unwanted Advances,” writes about coming of age in the short-lived equinox between the sexual revolution and the AIDS epidemic and then worries about a new campus culture in which, Kipnis says, “the slogans are all about sexual assault and other encroachments: ‘Stop Rape Culture,’ ‘No Means No,’ ‘Control Yourselves, Not Women.’” Nelson responds, “Insofar as my own personal and political proclivities have always drawn me away from what’s sometimes called carceral or governance feminism, and toward concepts (and experiences) of pleasure, liberation, life experience and contamination, I’m with Kipnis.” But now comes that Nelson turn: “Belittling a generation of impassioned activists and their concerns because they conflict with one’s own history or sensibility does not seem to me particularly wise; trying to shame people into sexual pleasure or liberation is probably even less effective than trying to shame them out of it.” “On Freedom” draws on Nelson’s long engagement with queer theory to tease out the difficulties in the drive toward what she describes as “one-size-fits-all” prescriptions about when sexual relations are acceptable or abhorrent. Queer people, she says, have reason to be skeptical about calls to invite the state or the university or the boss to police intimate relations. She asks us to think about what this might mean in practice: social workers analyzing “funky sexual material” on bookshelves or walls as they make adoption decisions; becoming a “sacrificial lamb” at work because your company is panicked by a complaint; being investigated by your college because of an accusation “made by tweet.” And then the call for context: “Fear of ‘slippery slope’ logic is not an excuse for letting misconduct go unaddressed. But proximity to the above situations has led me to believe that, as we address them, we owe ourselves and each other as much specificity and attention to context as we can muster, as well as a dedication not to treat anyone as roadkill.” The two final chapters of “On Freedom” explore the literature of addiction and the climate crisis. That addiction poses a challenge to our ideas of freedom is obvious, but Nelson wants us to start asking, too, “what can and will happen to our conception of freedom when we begin thinking it, feeling it, living it, apart from so many of our current fetishes and habits” — activities, that is, that imperil our environment. In discussion after discussion, Nelson shows the same alertness to context, intellectual modesty and the conviction that ethical goodness is never all on one side. She doesn’t aim to provide a positive account of the meaning of freedom. But if we understand freedom, above all, through our opposition to bondage, we can learn a great deal, as her book shows, from carefully cataloging and challenging the many ways of being unfree.",10,2021,2021_q4
2021-10-02,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/14/upshot/biden-jerome-powell-fed.html," President Biden is facing a big decision, and deep divides among his allies. Should he reappoint Jerome Powell to lead the Federal Reserve when Mr. Powell’s term ends early next year, or select a replacement who is more fully aligned with the Democratic policy agenda? Pro-Powell forces argue that he has proved exceptionally committed to generating a robust job market that will lead to better conditions for American workers. Those who argue against reappointment say that he has been too soft a regulator of banks and other financial institutions, and that he is insufficiently committed to using the Fed’s powers to combat climate change. But there is a more fundamental question for President Biden: What is his theory of how change happens? One theory of change is that, when a party wins the presidency and the Senate (however narrowly), it should put in place appointees who are fully fledged adherents of its agenda. These appointees will then push that agenda with every possible tool at their disposal. If they make lots of enemies, or see their more aggressive actions struck down by courts — or generally emerge as polarizing forces — so be it. If Mr. Biden were to take this approach, he might seek a firebrand for the top job at the Fed, betting that the nominee could both secure confirmation in a closely balanced Senate and steer the nation’s central bank toward a more activist stance on a range of liberal priorities. A reappointment of Mr. Powell would follow the opposite theory of change. In this version, there is great value in appointees who have the biography and political skill to make urgent policy changes seem sensible and reasonable, not scary. This strategy, the logic goes, will make more aggressive policy action achievable. And it could also make it more durable in the face of court challenges and changes in the control of government. Another leading candidate for the job, Lael Brainard, 59, would essentially split the difference between those approaches. She has been a Fed governor for the last seven years, collaborating closely with Mr. Powell and other top leaders of the central bank. She is hardly a firebrand; her speeches are carefully crafted and her positions well within the economics mainstream. But she is a Democrat who donated to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2016 and who dissented on numerous actions to loosen bank regulations championed by Trump appointees. She has also expressed public alarm about the economic implications of climate change. It is a distinctly different background and persona from Mr. Powell, a 68-year-old Princeton graduate who worked as a Wall Street dealmaker and private equity executive. He served in the George H.W. Bush administration, and was appointed to lead the central bank by President Donald J. Trump. He has also become, in recent years, a full-fledged convert to the religion of full employment. This is the view that the Fed should allow the economy to run hot enough that opportunity opens to people across American society, including historically marginalized groups. This view is more commonly embraced on the political left. But Mr. Powell came to it over the second half of the 2010s, as the labor market improved to levels far beyond what the Fed’s own economic models had envisioned without spurring unwelcome inflation. His stewardship of the Fed is, in that sense, the 21st-century American embodiment of the concept of “Tory men, Whig measures.” The phrase, from a 19th-century novel by Benjamin Disraeli, who would go on to become British prime minister, refers to a government in which hardheaded conservatives (the Tories) nevertheless carry out ideas that originated in left-of-center (Whig) circles, aimed at improving life for the masses. What would that mean if Mr. Powell were to be appointed to a second term as Fed chair starting in early 2022? It would mean that the major rethinking of the Fed’s approach to the labor market would continue to be led by a registered Republican whom 84 senators voted to confirm in 2018. Ms. Brainard was confirmed with 61 votes in 2014, including 11 Republicans. Part of the case for reappointing Mr. Powell is that his mere presence — his credibility on both sides of the aisle in Congress and on Wall Street — would be an asset to the administration’s broader economic project at a time of surging inflation and bubbly financial markets. The fact that he is not a Biden ally, or a Democrat at all, becomes a feature rather than a bug. “Part of the Biden mantra has been to restore civility and downplay partisan tensions,” said Sarah Binder, a George Washington University professor who has written extensively on the Fed’s place in American politics. “It’s somewhat fortuitous for Biden that if he wants to reappoint Powell he can do it under the guise of restoring the independence of the Fed even though Powell thoroughly fits his views on monetary policy.” During Mr. Powell’s chairmanship, the Fed has weakened several restrictions on big banks, loosening the capital and liquidity requirements placed on them, among other steps. It has also allowed several large bank mergers to occur. Ms. Brainard’s dissents from regulatory actions were unusual for the consensus-driven Fed. When she was the lone vote against one action in 2018, no governor had dissented from one in seven years. She would go on to dissent 20 times over the next three years. In regulatory policy, Fed leaders traditionally defer to elected leaders while aiming to maintain a wall of independence around monetary policymaking. And that has been enough to make presidents willing to reappoint Fed leaders from the other party even when they have disagreements over regulatory approach. The Fed chair Ben Bernanke, for example, was a Bush appointee. He was supportive of regulatory changes put in by the Obama-appointed Fed governor Dan Tarullo, and President Obama went on to reappoint Mr. Bernanke. Notably, as a Fed governor, Mr. Powell did not dissent from any regulatory steps championed by Mr. Tarullo. And while those cross-party reappointments have parallels to this moment — see also Ronald Reagan/Paul Volcker and Bill Clinton/Alan Greenspan — there may be an even closer historical parallel. In the 1930s, Franklin Delano Roosevelt turned not to any of the bright New Deal economists who were advising him on policy, but to a Utah banker named Marriner S. Eccles. Mr. Eccles embraced deficit spending and loose monetary policy to help propel the nation out of the Great Depression, but presented himself as merely a pragmatic businessman recommending a sensible course. He distanced himself from the more academic intellectuals tied to the administration. “Eccles served a very important purpose for the Roosevelt administration because he was a millionaire who espoused policies that were friendly to what Roosevelt wanted to do,” said Eric Rauchway, a historian at the University of California, Davis, and author of “Why the New Deal Matters.” In public appearances, Mr. Eccles emphasized that he arrived at his views not by reading John Maynard Keynes or other influential intellectuals of the era, but by working through things on his own. And while Mr. Eccles was closely aligned with the Roosevelt inner circle on macroeconomic management, he was more wary of other administration policies that involved expansive government control of the economy. And that, Mr. Rauchway said, was why he was placed at the Fed instead of the White House or Treasury. Mr. Biden is weighing a decision that will shape the economic backdrop of the remainder of his term. The question is whether the political logic that led Mr. Roosevelt to Mr. Eccles — and that led several other presidents to reappoint central bankers from the opposite party — applies in a world of high polarization and exceptionally high stakes.",10,2021,2021_q4
2021-10-02,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/21/technology/facebook-around-the-world.html," This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. Here is a collection of past columns. Facebook apps are popular almost everywhere in the world. But we might all be better off if they weren’t. The company’s most shameful human toll — its contribution to violence, human trafficking and abuses by authoritarian governments — has mostly happened in countries outside North America and Western Europe like India, Honduras, Myanmar, Ethiopia and the Philippines. What would happen if Facebook retreated from many of the countries where its social network and its Instagram and WhatsApp apps have done profound harm, even as they’ve given a voice to the voiceless? Years of horrific headlines have not led Facebook to make consistent progress in addressing its problems. Maybe it’s time for the company simply to leave countries like Myanmar and Azerbaijan until it devotes the same level of money, attention and cultural competence to its presence in those places as it devotes to its presence in the U.S. and France. (And Facebook is far from perfect in rich countries.) I don’t blame those of you who think that an American like me is being elitist for suggesting that after “Facebook broke democracy in many countries around the world,” as the Filipino journalist Maria Ressa has said, people in those places would be better off without the site. But maybe we should all ask ourselves radical questions about the horrors of Facebook: Is a better Facebook a realistic option, or is the solution a smaller Facebook? And what if no one can or should operate a hugely influential, lightning-fast communication mechanism for billions of people in nearly every country? There’s a deep irony in my suggestion that a less-global Facebook might be better. The power of people to use the network to express themselves, collaborate and challenge authority is more profound in places where institutions are weak or corrupt and where citizens haven’t had a voice. It’s also in those places where Facebook has done the most harm, and where the company and the world have paid the least attention. I felt a grim familiarity reading The Wall Street Journal’s series of articles about Facebook — particularly one that detailed how its employees grappled with persistent abuses in developing countries, including the ways drug cartels use Facebook apps to recruit hit men and governments use the network to incite ethnic violence. Three years after the United Nations concluded that Myanmar’s military turned the social network into a propaganda tool for genocide, The Journal’s reporting suggested that Facebook repeated some of the same mistakes and allowed this to happen again in Ethiopia. The Journal wrote that, as in Myanmar, Facebook’s staff and computerized systems weren’t capable of understanding the dialects of most posts that were encouraging violence against a persecuted ethnic group, which the U.S. government said was the target of ethnic cleansing. Ethiopians and Facebook employees had been warning the company of this risk. How many times do we need to read similar tales from Sri Lanka, Honduras or the Philippines before concluding that perhaps Facebook cannot capably operate in places where people are most vulnerable to online abuses? Facebook tends to say that it devotes considerable resources outside its home country to identify and delete accounts that spread dangerous propaganda or are otherwise used to mislead or hurt people. It’s hard to imagine Facebook retreating from the world by choice, but doing so wouldn’t be a catastrophic financial hit for the company. While it’s true that a vast majority of Facebook users are based outside the U.S., Canada and Europe, two-thirds of Facebook’s revenue comes from those regions. A tech giant in trouble. The leak of internal documents by a former Facebook employee has provided an intimate look at the operations of the secretive social media company and renewed calls for better regulations of the company’s wide reach into the lives of its users. How it began. In September, The Wall Street Journal published The Facebook Files, a series of reports based on leaked documents. The series exposed evidence that Facebook, which on Oct. 28 assumed the corporate name of Meta, knew Instagram, one of its products was worsening body-image issues among teenagers. The whistle-blower. During an interview with “60 Minutes” that aired Oct. 3, Frances Haugen, a Facebook product manager who left the company in May, revealed that she was responsible for the leak of those internal documents. Ms. Haugen’s testimony in Congress. On Oct. 5, Ms. Haugen testified before a Senate subcommittee, saying that Facebook was willing to use hateful and harmful content on its site to keep users coming back. Facebook executives, including Mark Zuckerberg, called her accusations untrue. The Facebook Papers. Ms. Haugen also filed a complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission and provided the documents to Congress in redacted form. A congressional staff member then supplied the documents, known as the Facebook Papers, to several news organizations, including The New York Times. New revelations. Documents from the Facebook Papers show the degree to which Facebook knew of extremist groups on its site trying to polarize American voters before the election. They also reveal that internal researchers had repeatedly determined how Facebook’s key features amplified toxic content on the platform. Similarly, Amazon generates about 90 percent of its revenue from just four countries — the U.S., Germany, Britain and Japan — and few people believe that the company’s global concentration is holding it back. Running a global internet company is not easy. But it’s also hard to watch Facebook be used as a tool for ethnic violence and authoritarian abuse and accept that this is a defensible downside to connecting the world. The new iPhones are FINE: Brian X. Chen says that the iPhone 13 “may be the most incremental update ever to the iPhone.” (You can check out the photos he snapped of his dogs with the latest models.) It’s OK for new phones to be meh. Brian writes that you can keep the phone you have for years without worrying that you’re missing anything major. We can’t look away. Is it helpful or hurtful? My colleague Katie Rosman explains why the news media and swarms of online sleuths on TikTok, Instagram and Twitter are obsessing over the disappearance of 22-year-old Gabrielle Petito. Wow, everyone is mad about this new time-share company: Residents of largely wealthy areas like Malibu and Sonoma, Calif., fear that their neighborhoods are being ruined by a start-up called Pacaso, which allows people to buy second homes with strangers, Vice News reports. People who own multimillion-dollar homes are worried that the wrong people are buying other multimillion-dollar homes.

2021-10-02,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/03/business/economy/august-2021-jobs-report.html," The American economy stumbled in August as the latest coronavirus wave forced employers to curtail hiring in the sectors that had spearheaded the job market’s recent resurgence. The gain of 235,000 jobs reported Friday by the Labor Department was well below what economists had expected and made August one of the weakest months for hiring since the recovery began more than a year ago. The softness was most apparent in lower-paid industries in which employees deal with customers face to face, like restaurants, bars, stores and hotels. What’s more, the pace slowed just before federally funded unemployment benefits expired for 7.5 million Americans and as the dividends from a government stimulus package enacted early in the year were fading, hampering growth. The August showing would have been respectable before the pandemic. But after seasonally adjusted gains of 962,000 in June and 1.05 million in July, it was a stark indication of the impact from the Delta variant of the coronavirus. Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, an accounting firm in Chicago, said the report was worrisome. “The worst effects of the Delta variant have yet to hit,” she said. “This is the beginning, not the end.” There are still 5.3 million fewer jobs nationwide than there were in February 2020. And the letup in hiring is a political setback for President Biden, who has sought to establish a solid economic foundation for the ambitious social programs he is trying to push through Congress. “I know people were looking, and I was hoping, for a higher number,” he said Friday. But he expressed optimism about the country’s economic direction, calling the recovery “durable and strong.” The latest data complicates plans for policymakers at the Federal Reserve, which has been buying $120 billion in government-backed bonds each month to keep borrowing cheap, bolstering lending and spending. Officials are debating when and how to ratchet down the bond purchases, and while many experts still expect an announcement in November, they said Delta could end up pushing that back. Moreover, the Labor Department data was collected in the second week of August, so it may not reflect the full extent of the Delta spread or the impact of Hurricanes Henri and Ida in the second half of the month. The figures also showed the first increase since December in the number of people working from home — a trend that could hinder the revival of service businesses that depend on office work and business travel. But even though the report was disappointing, the stock market barely reacted, and there were bits of good news. The unemployment rate dipped to 5.2 percent from 5.4 percent in July. Average hourly earnings increased 4.3 percent from the previous August, exceeding the expected 3.9 percent. And there were decent gains in employment in business and professional services as well as in manufacturing. Some employers, in fact, say their demand for workers exceeds the supply of candidates. “There are a lot of companies vying for employees,” said Joe Nelligan, chief executive of Molex, an electrical components manufacturer in the Chicago area that is part of Koch Industries. His company has created more flexible shifts to help lure workers, including running the lines on weekends for people who need to stay home during the week to take care of their children. “We’re being more creative and also trying to have more opportunities for advancement,” Mr. Nelligan said. Wages have also gone up, with hourly pay ranging from $15 to $20 in many locations. “We have a lot of tailwinds,” he said, citing demand for equipment for automobiles, data communications, health care and other uses. Estimates for economic growth in the current quarter are far short of the annual rate of 6.5 percent achieved in the second quarter. But the housing market remains robust, while Wall Street has been notching records on strong corporate results. Fidelity Investments said this week that it would bring on 9,000 additional workers by the end of the year, a sign of how Wall Street’s bullish run is creating jobs despite the pandemic. “We’ve been hiring consistently, and it’s driven by engagement with customers,” said Kirsten Kuykendoll, head of talent acquisition at Fidelity. The financial giant is looking for customer service representatives, financial advisers, and technology specialists like software engineers and data scientists. But consumers are changing their habits again, a pattern with the potential to reshape growth if it continues. Hiring in the leisure and hospitality industry — which was devastated by the pandemic and then added 2.1 million jobs from January to July — was flat in August. Restaurant reservations on OpenTable were close to normal levels earlier in the summer, but are now 10 percent below where they were before the pandemic. There has also been a sharp decline in hours worked at restaurants and entertainment venues, according to data from Homebase, which provides time-management software to small businesses. “We got another reminder of how significant the pandemic is in determining progress in our economy,” said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust. “It’s a clear indication of what the outbreak has done.” Retailers shed 28,500 positions in August, a sign that consumers have pulled back on shopping. Economists at Morgan Stanley said on Friday that they expected the August figures for core retail sales — including food services but excluding auto dealers, gasoline stations and home improvement stores — to show a decline of 2.1 percent after a drop of 0.6 percent in July. They said global supply chain disruptions from the pandemic, which have been compounded by the spread of Delta, were presenting “further headwinds.” As has been the case since the start of the pandemic, the economic fortunes of Americans are deeply divided. For college graduates, the unemployment rate in August was 2.8 percent. By contrast, joblessness among those with just a high school diploma was 6 percent. Those with less education are much more dependent on the sectors that were weakest in the August report, like restaurants, bars, hotels and stores, where wages are lower and job security is an afterthought. Lower-paid workers in general find themselves making tough choices as benefits expire and options narrow. Wayne Pick, 52, took a job as a United States Postal Service carrier in late August after more than a year out of work. He will make more than $10,000 a year less than he did in his previous job as an assistant property manager in Chicago. But with unemployment benefits expiring this month, he wouldn’t have been able to pay his mortgage if he didn’t take the carrier job, he said. “I took it in desperation,” he said. “I held out for the longest time. The unemployment benefits were very generous.” Things were looking up in May, when infection rates were down and more people were vaccinated, Mr. Pick said. He was getting more interviews, many of them in person. But once the Delta variant began to spread, he said, he started getting fewer calls. He is continuing to apply for jobs in the hope of finding something that pays better. “I don’t really hold out a lot of hope,” Mr. Pick said. “Things in the city really aren’t doing that well.” Reporting was contributed by Ben Casselman, Madeleine Ngo, Jeanna Smialek and Jim Tankersley.",10,2021,2021_q4
2021-08-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/06/business/dealbook/china-big-tech.html," Tensions are growing between China and tech companies inside — and outside — its borders. China is cracking down on domestic tech giants with U.S. ties. On Sunday, Beijing officials ordered Didi, the ride-hailing app, to be removed from the country’s app stores over concerns about the handling of customer data, days after the company completed a blockbuster U.S. I.P.O. Yesterday, they suspended new user registrations for platforms run by two other Chinese companies that recently listed shares in New York, citing the need for cybersecurity reviews. Didi’s shares fell nearly 30 percent in premarket trading, below their I.P.O. price. Meanwhile, U.S. tech firms are making threats about their businesses in Hong Kong. Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and other American tech groups have threatened to pull out of the territory if the government doesn’t roll back efforts to control online speech there. The threat was made in a letter sent last month by an American trade group representing Big Tech in Asia. A trans-Pacific tech breakup would be messy. Many large U.S. tech companies, notably Apple, have spent billions of dollars building their presences in China, both by moving manufacturing there and by courting local customers. An investigation by The Times showed the lengths Apple has gone to keep Chinese regulators happy, even breaking some of the privacy pledges the company has made to customers. Going the other way, Chinese tech firms have enthusiastically tapped U.S. capital markets, raising more than $15 billion in New York I.P.O.s this year, according to Bloomberg. China’s crackdown last year on Ant Group, which postponed plans to go public in Shanghai and Hong Kong, made its shallower domestic markets less appealing to local firms. Some see Beijing’s latest campaign as retaliation for selling stakes to U.S. investors, and the 30-odd companies that have pending U.S. listings — and the investors they have lined up to buy shares — may now think twice.

The high-powered Allen & Company gathering in Idaho is back this week after being canceled last year, with off-the-record discussions of topics like media takeovers. Expected attendees, according to The Wall Street Journal, include Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, the new Amazon C.E.O., Andy Jassy and — perhaps awkwardly — Discovery’s David Zaslav and his soon-to-be employee, WarnerMedia’s Jason Kilar. Hundreds of companies around the world are reeling after a software provider to small- and medium-sized businesses was hit by a major cyberattack. Russian cybercriminals are suspected of orchestrating what some experts are calling a “global supply chain hack.” The damage is widespread. The Swedish grocery chain Coop had to close at least 800 stores on Saturday, while a pharmacy chain and 11 schools in New Zealand were also affected. Linking all of them was Kaseya, which makes systems management software that was in the middle of performing updates to guard against such an attack. Although Kaseya said that fewer than 40 customers had been affected, that group serviced hundreds of others, amplifying the effect. Some companies were asked for as much as $5 million to regain control of their data — about $70 million in total. The authorities suspect a well-known Russian group. REvil, which was accused of orchestrating an attack on the meat processor JBS in May, was identified as a likely culprit. While President Biden confronted Vladimir Putin last month over Moscow’s ties to cybercrime, Biden said over the weekend, “The initial thinking was it was not the Russian government, but we’re not sure yet.” —Raj Rajkumar, a Carnegie Mellon professor, on how Tesla’s Autopilot system tracks drivers’ alertness.

Investors are demanding more information from companies about environmental, social and governance, or E.S.G., issues. Regulators are taking notice but aren’t coming to the same conclusions on what to do about it. “We are clearly at a tipping point,” said Michael Passoff, the head of Proxy Impact, a shareholder services firm. He told DealBook that in 25 years of working in sustainable investing, the enthusiasm among shareholders for E.S.G. resolutions this year was “unprecedented.” So far, 34 such proposals at public companies have gained a majority vote, surpassing last year’s record-setting total of 21. Half of the successful shareholder votes on such proposals in the past decade have occurred in the past two years. “You cannot direct the wind, but you can adjust your sails,” said Allison Herren Lee, an S.E.C. commissioner, in remarks to the Society for Corporate Governance. Lee, who has made E.S.G. a focus of her recent work, urged corporate board members to recognize the movement’s momentum. “This proxy season is just the latest affirmation of a sea change on climate and E.S.G.,” she said, adding that the S.E.C.’s disclosure rules should “provide investors with adequate information to test public pledges” that companies make on these issues. “What if the sustainability standards turn out to be flawed?” asked Hester Peirce, another S.E.C. commissioner, in a letter to an accounting standards-setting body, whose “gaze has drifted to sustainability reporting,” she said. “We must be careful not to compromise accounting standard-setting in an effort to achieve objectives other than high-quality financial reporting, no matter how noble those objectives may be.” She will detail what role she thinks the S.E.C. should play in E.S.G. at a Brookings Institution event this month.

2021-08-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/27/business/stock-market-today.html," A global tech stock sell-off helped push stocks back from record highs on Tuesday, as investors waited for more positive news from a string of earnings reports due from American tech giants after the close of trading. The S&P 500 was fell 0.5 percent. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended on Tuesday that people vaccinated for the coronavirus resume wearing masks indoors in certain parts of the country, reversing a decision made just two months ago. Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft will provide updates on their financial performance on Tuesday. The reports come during a time of growing scrutiny of Big Tech with President Biden signing an executive order earlier this month intended to increase competition within the nation’s economy and to limit corporate dominance. Alphabet fell 1.6 percent and Apple fell 1.5 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 1.2 percent. The tensions between governments and technology are increasingly global. Chinese stocks plunged again on Tuesday, as a crackdown by the authoritarian state continued on its homegrown tech titans. The Chinese tech conglomerate Tencent tumbled 9 percent after it closed its WeChat app to new users to “align with all relevant laws and regulations.” The delivery service Meituan tumbled 18 percent after the government published new regulations requiring such services to pay at least minimum wage. Alibaba fell more than 6 percent in Hong Kong. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng plunged more than 4 percent. And the CSI 300 index of stocks listed on mainland indexes dropped more than 3.5 percent. The Hang Seng has lost more than 14 percent over the last month.

2021-08-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/us/politics/carl-levin-dead.html," Carl Levin, a liberal Michigan Democrat who served 36 years in the Senate and scared the wits out of America’s biggest C.E.O.s by demanding explanations for shadowy schemes that hid billions in profits overseas and avoided vast corporate taxes at home, died on Thursday in Detroit. He was 87. His death was confirmed by the Levin Center at Wayne State University. Mr. Levin had disclosed in March that he had lung cancer, Jim Townsend, a spokesman for the family, said. The longest-serving senator in Michigan history — from 1979 to 2015 — Mr. Levin was regarded by Senate colleagues and Washington observers as a paragon of probity as the chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. He wielded subpoena power, huge briefing books, a big gavel and an unquenchable zeal for grilling high-profile witnesses at public hearings. With his longish silver hair, affable smile and glasses perched low on the nose, he looked more like a kindly Old-World shoemaker than the terror of the Senate. But he confronted the titans of JPMorgan Chase, Apple, American Express and other corporate giants like a barbarian at the gates, and extracted admissions about overseas banking havens and mind-boggling tax-avoidance maneuvers that rendered profits invisible and made tax burdens vanish into thin air. “Levin has shown how profits can be shipped tax-free to the Cayman Islands and, amazingly, how Apple figured out that profits booked in Ireland could be hidden from tax authorities of both Ireland and the United States in a cloak of invisibility,” David Cay Johnston wrote in a 2014 essay, “The Legacy of Carl Levin,” in The American Prospect, a liberal quarterly. Mr. Johnston said Mr. Levin showed how Apple escaped $10 billion in taxes every year from 2009 to 2012; how Microsoft siphoned $8 billion to Singapore and Irish subsidiaries and lowered its effective tax rate on the money to 3 percent; and how Goldman Sachs sold clients securities that it later bet would fail, “eliciting eye-opening testimony from its C.E.O., Lloyd Blankfein, who saw nothing wrong with this.” Mr. Levin documented conflicts of interest and other wrongdoing that led to the 2008 financial crisis, which threatened global markets and produced the worst recession since the Great Depression. In 2013, a 300-page report by Mr. Levin’s panel detailed JPMorgan Chase’s $6.2 billion loss fiasco by rogue traders. “In corporate America, the scariest seat in Washington is the front row of a hearing room where Carl Levin holds the gavel,” Politico reported in 2014. “His retirement next January has executives exhaling.” Reginald Brown, a lawyer who represented several targets of Mr. Levin’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, told Politico: “The first thing I tell people is, PSI stands for ‘pretty scary investigations.’” Senator Levin, who was also known for opposing the war in Iraq and for advocating tighter controls over handguns and nuclear weapons, was one of his state’s most popular politicians — narrowly elected to the Senate on his first try, but re-elected five times by widening margins. He was the Senate’s fourth-longest serving incumbent when he retired at age 80. He was the most prominent member of a Michigan family that embraced public service. His brother, Sander Levin, a former United States representative, was the chairman of the powerful tax-writing Ways and Means Committee and had a congressional career of more than three decades that almost paralleled Carl’s. Other relatives were federal and state judges or held other elective or appointive offices. A nephew, Andy Levin, serves in the House as a Democrat representing a district north of Detroit. Carl Levin joined a class of 20 freshman senators in 1979 that included the Democrats Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, and the Republicans Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming and William S. Cohen of Maine. Many hit the ground running. Mr. Levin became floor manager of legislation to implement recently ratified Panama Canal treaties, and won a tough fight for more funds for child care. The liberal Mr. Levin and the conservative Mr. Simpson found that they shared a passion for baseball, and after a tour of defense installations in San Diego that summer they attended a Padres game together. Midway through the game, the scoreboard lit up: “Let’s give a Big Padres Welcome to Senator Simpson of Wyoming and Senator Levin of Michigan!” The stadium erupted in nonpartisan Bronx cheers. In 1981, Americans for Democratic Action, a national liberal organization, issued its ratings of senators’ voting records for the previous year. It gave its highest rating, 94 percent, to Mr. Levin, and its lowest, 0, to Senator Barry M. Goldwater, the Arizona Republican. Mr. Levin’s votes in the Senate over the decades were consistent with that early assessment, except on home-state issues like fuel economy for cars, which he opposed, and bailouts and other measures to aid Detroit’s automotive industries, which he backed enthusiastically. He supported funds for education, measures for environmental protections and trade regulations that, advocates said, improved public health and created jobs. He sponsored a ban on assault weapons, was rated “F” by the National Rifle Association and voted to ratify treaties to control nuclear weapons and ban intercontinental ballistic missiles. While he had no military experience, Senator Levin served for 10 years — from 2001 to 2003 and from 2007 to 2015 — as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, a platform from which he exerted a major influence on military appropriations and defense policies. He exposed wasteful and corrupt practices by military contractors, voted to close bases, pushed for less secrecy in government and was instrumental in lifting the ban on gays in the military. He argued that military commanders, not civilian officials, should retain authority over sexual assault cases in the armed forces, arguing that doing so would afford more protection for victims. After the 2001 terrorist attacks, he voted to give President George W. Bush authority to go after the perpetrators. But he grew critical of American fighting in Afghanistan and was an early opponent of the Iraq war, voicing skepticism over the administration’s claim that President Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. He hailed President Barack Obama’s 2011 decision to withdraw American troops from Iraq. Carl Milton Levin was born in Detroit on June 28, 1934, one of three children of Saul Levin and the former Bess Levinson. His father was a lawyer and member of Michigan’s Correction Commission, which ran state prisons. Public affairs dominated dinner conversations, the father asking Carl, his brother and sister, Hannah, for opinions on capital punishment, mayoral decisions and other topics. Carl graduated from Detroit Central High School in 1952, from Swarthmore College in 1956 with a bachelor’s degree in political science, and from Harvard Law School in 1959. He married Barbara Halpern in 1961. They had three daughters, Kate, Laura and Erica. He is survived by his wife, daughters, brother and six grandchildren. Mr. Levin lived in Detroit all his life. After five years practicing law in Detroit, he became an assistant attorney general and general counsel for the Michigan Civil Rights Commission from 1964 to 1967. He helped form the Detroit Public Defender’s office, and in 1968-69 was its chief appellate defender. He served two terms on the Detroit City Council from 1969 to 1977, the last four years as president. He also became a close associate of Coleman Young, a Democrat who in 1974 became Detroit’s first African American mayor. Mr. Levin defeated Republicans in six Senate races: the incumbent, Robert Griffin, in 1978; the former astronaut Jack R. Lousma in 1984; Representative Bill Schuette in 1990; Ronna Romney, a radio talk show host, in 1996; Andrew Raczkowski in 2002; and Jack Hoogendyk, a state representative, in 2008. Mr. Levin said in 2013 that he would not seek a seventh term. “I will miss Carl Levin when he leaves the Senate after the next election — and you will too,” Joe Nocera, then an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times, wrote at the time. “Levin has done more than anyone to expose the scams, the conflicts, the wrongdoing and the sheer idiocy of the financial industry from the run-up to the financial crisis to the present day.” Michael Levenson contributed reporting.",8,2021,2021_q3

Soon, the story caught fire. The deli was featured in the Financial Times, The New Yorker, The New York Post and on NPR. “Your Hometown Deli in Paulsboro, N.J., was just an unassuming sandwich stop,” CBS News reported. “Now it’s a Wall Street mystery.” These types of financial enigmas have reached near ubiquity during the pandemic. But Your Hometown Deli was uniquely hard to explain. Had someone made it climb? Was the situation an accident, or intentional? And if had been done intentionally — why?

He clocked in almost 50 years of service to the Trump family, first working for Fred Trump and then, from 1986, his son Donald. Mr. Weisselberg was Donald Trump’s money man, a financial enforcer who tracked every penny. After gaining access to years’ worth of the Trump Organization’s tax documents, the Manhattan district attorney’s office decided to zero in on Mr. Weisselberg, bringing criminal charges against him. The goal is to get him to cooperate with the investigation, but will he flip on the former president? Ben Protess, an investigative reporter for The New York Times.

2021-08-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/14/style/modern-love-podcast-upside-of-our-parents-divorce.html," What’s the secret to sibling success? Apparently, an ugly divorce. At least, that’s how it went down for Ellen Umansky and her two brothers. Ellen’s parents separated when she was 9. “They loved us deeply, but there were battles to be won — emotional, reputational, financial,” Ellen wrote in her Modern Love essay. Ellen and her brothers were flung into a new reality of parental feuds and convoluted calendar arrangements. Amid this, her brothers became her family within the family — her “one constant and comfort.” Today’s episode is about “Team Umansky,” as Ellen’s husband calls them, a unit that has stuck together from adolescence through adulthood. At the end of today’s episode, we hear about another set of siblings with a lasting connection: Kim Addonizio and her brother Gary Addie. In her Tiny Love Story, Kim wrote about a particularly difficult period in her adult life: “A family holiday card that year would have shown our faces being scratched out: father dead, mother in assisted living, one brother in a coma.” And to top it off, Kim had recently broken up with her boyfriend. But on Christmas that year, Gary took Kim ice skating — an activity they used to do as children. Though Kim was wobbly on the ice, Gary gave her ibuprofen and a Walkman playing John Coltrane. He encouraged her to “trust the edge.” Kim is a year older than Gary, but she has always thought of him as her twin. “I feel like our mother’s egg split, and one of us just stayed in the womb an extra year and then came out,” Kim said in the episode. “More and more, we’ve become best friends over the years.” Hosted by: Daniel Jones and Miya LeeProduced by: Julia Botero, Hans Buetow and Tracy MumfordEdited by: Sara SarasohnExecutive Producer: Wendy DorrMusic by: Marion Lozano and Dan PowellMixed by: Corey SchreppelNarrated by: Kirsten PotterSpecial thanks: Julia Simon, Mahima Chablani, Bonnie Wertheim, Anya Strzemien, Sam Dolnick and Ryan Wegner at Audm.

2021-08-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/10/style/metaverse-virtual-worlds.html," The biggest ideas in tech often lurch into the lexicon before they are truly coherent. Jargon appears out of nowhere, underexplained and overused: the internet of things, the sharing economy, the cloud. In some rare cases, the terminology sticks. A lot of people talk a lot about a lot of loosely related things, and then those things merge into a single semi-comprehensible thing. Then we live our lives within that thing forever. Remember hearing about “the internet”? Get ready for “the metaverse.” The term comes from digital antiquity: Coined by the writer Neal Stephenson in his 1992 novel, “Snow Crash,” then reimagined as the Oasis in the Ernest Cline novel “Ready Player One,” it refers to a fully realized digital world that exists beyond the analog one in which we live. In fiction, a utopian metaverse may be portrayed as a new frontier where social norms and value systems can be written anew, freed from cultural and economic sclerosis. But more often metaverses are a bit dystopian — virtual refuges from a fallen world. As a buzzword, the metaverse refers to a variety of virtual experiences, environments and assets that gained momentum during the online-everything shift of the pandemic. Together, these new technologies hint at what the internet will become next. Video games like Roblox and Fortnite and Animal Crossing: New Horizons, in which players can build their own worlds, have metaverse tendencies, as does most social media. If you own a non-fungible token or even just some crypto, you’re part of the metaversal experience. Virtual and augmented reality are, at a minimum, metaverse adjacent. If you’ve attended a work meeting or a party using a digital avatar, you’re treading into the neighborhood of metaversality. Founders, investors, futurists and executives have all tried to stake their claim in the metaverse, expounding on its potential for social connection, experimentation, entertainment and, crucially, profit. Matthew Ball, a venture capitalist and prolific essayist, describes the metaverse not as a virtual world or a space, but as “a sort of successor state to the mobile internet” — a framework for an extremely connected life. There “will be no clean ‘Before Metaverse’ and ‘After Metaverse,’” he writes. “Instead, it will slowly emerge over time as different products, services and capabilities integrate and meld together.” Speaking to CNET in May, Mark Zuckerberg shared his own Facebook-centric view: “We want to get as many people as possible to be able to experience virtual reality and be able to jump into the metaverse and to have these social experiences within that,” he said, referring to the company’s experimental virtual reality environment, Horizon, which he hopes people will explore using Facebook’s Oculus headsets. In a June interview with VentureBeat, Jensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia, which makes computer chips, shared more of a vibe than a vision: “We’ll be able to almost feel like we’re there with each other.” If all that sounds too heady, for now this might do: The metaverse is the internet, but so much more. And though it may still be in the future, if it materializes at all, it seems closer than it’s ever been. Earlier this year, in the midst of a crypto boom, the price of a currency called MANA began climbing the charts in Coinbase, a popular exchange for digital currencies. MANA is the currency of a virtual world called Decentraland, where in March plots of digital land were going for the equivalent of hundreds of thousands of dollars. (After two years bouncing around 10 cents, MANA briefly broke $1.60 in April, pushing the combined value of all the tokens past $2.4 billion.) By size, Decentraland is more of a commune — as of July, just a few hundred people are logged in at a time, down from a March peak in the low thousands — made up of user-generated NFTs. Its creators have described the platform less as a place than as infrastructure upon which to build a place. (Decentraland’s currency and land contracts run on the Ethereum blockchain.) Denizens of Decentraland are constantly creating scenes and experiences for other users, like concerts and art exhibits. There are casinos where you can gamble in MANA, with croupiers who are paid in MANA to show up for work. The sense that Decentraland is a work in progress pervades the sparsely populated grid of half-developed plots and themed zones. Between events, users are mostly left to wander and wonder: What now? Speculators seem less confused; after all, Decentraland is first and foremost an experiment in scarce digital property. This month, Republic Realm, which calls itself a “digital real estate firm,” purchased an NFT of a 259-parcel virtual estate in Decentraland for more than 1.2 million MANA, or, at contemporaneous exchange rates, more than $900,000. Sotheby’s, which acquired a small plot in Decentraland’s arts district and constructed a replica of its London galleries, recently closed its first show in the metaverse. Michael Bouhanna, who ran the sale, estimated that 90 percent of the galleries’ 3,200 visitors had little sense of what Sotheby’s is or does, but said the exercise was useful for helping existing customers conceptualize NFTs, which the auction house is already selling. What separates Decentraland from its predecessors like Second Life, a virtual world owned and operated by a private company called Linden Labs, is that it is indeed fairly decentralized. The plan, according to Decentraland’s founders, was always for its users to take ownership of the world, building and doing what they please. By contrast, Dave Carr, a spokesman for the Decentraland Foundation, said, “Fortnite is a centralized experience,” meaning that it functions top-down, with major decisions coming from its developer, Epic Games. “Here, you feel like you have a definite part in it.” When Epic was developing Fortnite, its plan was not to create a metaverse. But what started in 2017 as a tower defense-style game where players fought zombies exploded, just a year later, into an international phenomenon. “It took off in a way none of us quite anticipated,” said Donald Mustard, the chief creative officer of Epic. As millions of players flocked to Fortnite Battle Royale, a game mode that is a bit like “The Hunger Games,” the company rushed to add social features, like voice chatting and dance parties. In financial documents made public in federal court in May as part of an antitrust suit against Apple, Epic said Fortnite made more than $9 billion in revenue in 2018 and 2019 combined. Players spend money to dress up their characters in superhero costumes and banana suits. Now, Epic markets Fortnite as not just an interactive experience but as a metaverse. “It’s more than a game,” Matthew Weissinger, the vice president of marketing at Epic, said in court. “We’re building this thing called the metaverse — a social place.” A Travis Scott concert held within Fortnite last April drew more than 12 million concurrent views, the company said. And nearly 50 percent of players are using the game’s creative mode, which allows users to populate their own islands with buildings and games, said Tim Sweeney, the chief executive of Epic. For Mr. Sweeney, the formation of the metaverse also entails a fight for its independence. Without specifically referring to Epic’s lawsuit against Apple, which is set to be decided in the next few months, he alluded to it several times. Defining the metaverse was difficult, he said, but he knew what it was not: “The metaverse is not an App Store with a catalog of titles,” Mr. Sweeney said. “In the metaverse, you and your friends and your appearance and cosmetics can go from place to place and have different experiences while remaining connected to each other socially.” Could it be possible one day to have a tunnel from Roblox to Fortnite and other games, connecting them all in some sort of futuristic world? Mr. Sweeney said yes. Roblox, a platform where independent developers create games popular with children, may be the nearest and most expansive vision of the metaverse. In the first quarter of 2021, people spent nearly 10 billion hours playing Roblox, according to the company’s earnings report, and more than 42 million users logged in each day. Players also spent $652 million on the site’s virtual currency, Robux, which can be used to purchase hats, weapons, hot air balloons and other digital items for their characters. After going public on March 10, the company’s valuation shot to $45 billion; as of this week, it’s closer to $50 billion. Dave Baszucki, Roblox’s co-founder and chief executive, whose shares in the company were suddenly worth $5.5 billion when the market closed that day, expressed his appreciation on Twitter. Mr. Baszucki declined to be interviewed for this article, but he has spoken widely and ambitiously about Roblox as a metaverse. He has said his goal is to reach billions of people with Roblox, not just children. At an investor presentation in February, he said the company holds its business meetings on the platform. “Just as the mail, the telegraph, the telephone, text and video are utilities for collaborative work, we believe Roblox and the metaverse will join these as essential tools for business communication,” Mr. Baszucki said. “Ultimately, someday we may even shop within Roblox.” Indeed, in May, a digital Gucci bag sold on the platform for more than $4,100, exceeding the price of the physical object. (There’s also a darker side to Roblox, not condoned by the company, that includes strip clubs, sex parties and Nazi re-enactments.) There are millions of games created on Roblox each year, and much of the money they generate — through the sale of digital items and upgrades — goes to independent developers. In some cases, game makers in their teens have become millionaires. Ammon Runger, a 16-year-old, and his colleague Stefan Baronio, 23, have made six-figure salaries producing the prison-escape game Mad City, which attracts more than 200,000 players a month. Mr. Baronio bought a new car and paid for college with the money. He said the experience has been “life changing” but stopped short of calling Roblox a metaverse. “I definitely feel like they’re getting there, but I still think they’re pretty far away from it,” Mr. Baronio said. Half of the platform’s players are 13 or younger, the company said. In any case, the company is forging ahead. Craig Donato, the chief business officer of Roblox, said that 17- to 24-year-olds are the platform’s fastest-growing consumers, and the company is adding more languages as it expands its user base around the world. Mr. Donato said that during the pandemic he spent so much time meeting in the company’s virtual office that upon returning to the physical space, he had to remind himself that he could not do the same things as his Roblox character. “I was like, ‘Gosh, I have to make sure I don’t jump out the window,’” he said. While there is a lot of corporate interest in the metaverse, skeptics abound. Strauss Zelnick, the chief executive of the game publisher Take-Two, said in a May earnings call that he was “allergic to buzzwords,” and suggested the metaverse could be all hype. “If you take metaverse, SPAC and cryptocurrency, in five years, will any of this matter? I’m not sure it will,” he said. Then there are those who wonder whether interest from the tech sector is simply opportunistic, or missing the point entirely. Evo Heyning, for instance, has been working and playing in the metaverse for two decades. The State Department even hired her to help build its presence on Second Life. In earlier virtual worlds, Ms. Heyning said, “it was always seen as people participating in a new type of public commons. Now, obviously lots of companies are going to assert dominance.” Hopes and assurances from tech executives are nice, but private platforms are private platforms. “Right now, I can create an avatar, but I can’t jump from one world to the next,” Ms. Heyning said, describing a concept known as “interoperability.” The metaverse, in her view, isn’t a single firm or organization’s product or space, or even all of them together —  it’s the way they’re connected. In pursuit of that connection, Ms. Heyning, 45, has joined a few volunteers to form the Open Metaverse Interoperability Group, which seeks to establish technological standards for “bridging virtual worlds,” in the hope that metaverse players will adopt them. Robert Long, who is also part of the group, compared his hopes for the fledgling metaverse to the early web. “There is no single owner of the whole thing,” he said. “It’s decentralized in the same way the web is, with lots of different people hosting it. We’re looking for the HTML of the metaverse.” Kayvon Tehranian, a founder and the chief executive of Foundation, a marketplace for NFTs, also sees building the metaverse as a chance to get right what he believes former stewards, and users, of the internet got wrong. The key, he said, is blockchain technology. How people engage with the metaverse is secondary. “The fact that we’re surrounded by a global layer that’s there at all times,” Mr. Tehranian said, referring to the Ethereum blockchain, “where there’s no central party that determines whether or not something is available or not?” That, he said, is the antidote to the digital world we already live in — one that he describes as akin to a metaverse but “with dictators” (Apple, Google, Facebook). His metaverse hews to a particular definition of freedom. “The thing I really care about is that you as an individual own objects,” he said. “Property ownership is a tool. It works. It brings financial incentives.” This may sound, depending on your ideological orientation, more dystopian than utopian. To Mr. Tehranian, it’s merely realistic. “We’re still talking about human nature, which is greedy and selfish,” he said. Indeed, many are looking at the metaverse as a financial opportunity. Mike Winkelmann — a.k.a. Beeple, the guy who sold an NFT of his artwork for $69 million — is working on a start-up called Wenew, which will sell NFTs associated with moments in time, creating, in the company’s words, “the memory palace of the metaverse.” (Its early offerings include moments from the tennis star Andy Murray’s career.) Despite his stake in the crypto-oriented vision of the metaverse, Mr. Winkelmann’s sense of what it might be, or already is, remains wide. Whatever the metaverse is, it’s not just virtual reality, or augmented reality, or the blockchain and NFTs, or virtual worlds and games. “People are very much looking at it as this ‘Ready Player One’ thing, or a V.R. thing,” he said. “That’s just about how close that screen is to your face,” he continued, holding his phone up to his eyes. “This doesn’t change the fact that a lot of these things are happening in a space that is already virtual.” It’s just going to continue the blend, he said, until we’re all wearing goggles, or living in tanks of goo, after a gradual and disorienting transition from the internet of today, which is, perhaps, more metaversal than it gets credit for. “It’s a primitive version of what’s coming,” Mr. Winkelmann said.",8,2021,2021_q3
2021-08-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/21/style/jeff-bezos-space-image.html," Perhaps the most noteworthy thing about the whole thing was that it wasn’t that noteworthy at all: another Tuesday. Another billionaire businessman paying to catapult himself into space. Yet the sight of Jeff Bezos, in his beige cowboy hat and blue spacesuit (wearing a custom Omega Speedmaster over the sleeve as if he were Buzz Aldrin), high-fiving astronauts and then waxing profound about the experience afterward, resonated in ways that Sir Richard Branson’s wild ride did not. It has taken Amazon just 27 years to become a $1.8 trillion company. Depending on the oscillations of the stock market, Mr. Bezos is either the richest or the second richest man in the world. Yet he has become this without achieving commensurate mystique. He has not, like Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, hosted “Saturday Night Live” and managed to do a surprisingly good job at it. He has not, like Apple’s co-founder Steve Jobs, shown Americans the power of a minimalist mock neck. He did not, like Twitter’s Jack Dorsey, spend a pandemic quarantining with Jay-Z. All those guys inspire enmity, especially Mr. Musk and (even posthumously) Mr. Jobs. But the lines for their products reveal the emotional connection people have to them. They invented FOMO. Mr. Bezos merely capitalized on it and embodies it. We watched as he went to the gym, got biceps and bought motorcycle jackets. The problem was never the fit. It was that they seemed to accomplish the opposite of their intended purpose, which is to telegraph the chicness of indifference. We read about the end of his marriage to MacKenzie Scott, a novelist turned mega-philanthropist, and the beginning of his romance with Lauren Sanchez, a former correspondent on the tabloid entertainment show “Extra!” It seemed like a cliché. We gasped at the intimate text messages he sent her. They were just so goofy, as if he’d consulted Siri for sexting advice. We looked at the pictures of his four-story $96 million real estate investment in the Flatiron district. It seemed soulless, like something that would be designed by Marriott should it build its version of an André Balazs hotel. Yet by being worth around $200 billion and having few people who are likely to tell him the truth about, say, how he looks in a cowboy hat riding his phallic rocket, he has become the Dorian Gray of dorkiness, a locus classicus and fun-house mirror through which a sizable contingent of usually white men, approaching middle age and unpossessed of Ryan Gosling’s looks, should see ourselves, if we become honest enough to admit the errors of spending our way into regrettable stylistic choices. There’s an onomatopoetic quality to Mr. Bezos’ name. A dentist with a Lamborghini is a Bezos. So is anyone in commercial real estate who, having just embarked on his first extramarital affair, starts shaving areas of himself that should not be shaved. I turned into a Bezos the day I decided to try and pull off a fanny pack and a pair of bootleg Dior shorts. Pretending to be an oenophile makes a Bezos of many a man. So does deciding that it is not enough of an accomplishment to run a financial services company; that what one really needs is a side job on the weekends as a tropical house and EDM D.J. If you returned from your first trip to Burning Man at 50, you are treading dangerously close to Bezos territory. If you have made attempts to book a singer like Jennifer Lopez, Stevie Wonder, John Legend, Patti LaBelle or Christina Aguilera at your wedding, birthday party or child’s religious gathering, you are a Bezos. Bezoses are more likely to be rich than poor, but using Affirm at checkout has helped many less fortunate types achieve Bezosdom. It’s hard, but not impossible, for a movie star to be a Bezos. Mark Wahlberg, sporting a diamond encrusted Patek Phillipe sports watch that would be a joke in a Paul Thomas Anderson movie starring Mark Wahlberg, is most certainly a Bezos. So is Ben Affleck anytime he has his shirt off, and we can see the enormous phoenix he had permanently etched onto his back. Bezoses want to believe that the time spent on Pelotons over the last year is enough to justify ordering a Speedo over Amazon. Or that with a few good years left for our knees, we could still take up skateboarding or fly off in a rocket ship and become a Butch Cassidy for the skies, with a hat (and boots) to match. Here’s the problem: Butch Cassidy became Butch Cassidy by stealing. A Bezos compensates with a credit card. Shortly after descending to earth, Mr. Bezos went and did a news conference where he said: “I want to thank every Amazon employee and every Amazon customer because you guys paid for all this. Seriously.” It was a curious admission coming from a guy whose underlings are protesting their working conditions and meager delivery salaries. But what did everyone expect of a space cowboy in blue satin? He’s the world’s biggest Bezos.",8,2021,2021_q3
2021-08-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/20/magazine/gmos.html," To hear more audio stories from publications like The New York Times, download Audm for iPhone or Android. On a cold December day in Norwich, England, Cathie Martin met me at a laboratory inside the John Innes Centre, where she works. A plant biologist, Martin has spent almost two decades studying tomatoes, and I had traveled to see her because of a particular one she created: a lustrous, dark purple variety that is unusually high in antioxidants, with twice the amount found in blueberries. At 66, Martin has silver-white hair, a strong chin and sharp eyes that give her a slightly elfin look. Her office, a tiny cubby just off the lab, is so packed with binders and piles of paper that Martin has to stand when typing on her computer keyboard, which sits surrounded by a heap of papers like a rock that has sunk to the bottom of a snowdrift. “It’s an absolute disaster,” Martin said, looking around fondly. “I’m told that the security guards bring people round on the tour.” On the desk, there’s a drinks coaster with a picture of an attractive 1950s housewife that reads, “You say tomato, I say [expletive] you.” Martin has long been interested in how plants produce beneficial nutrients. The purple tomato is the first she designed to have more anthocyanin, a naturally occurring anti-inflammatory compound. “All higher plants have a mechanism for making anthocyanins,” Martin explained when we met. “A tomato plant makes them as well, in the leaves. We just put in a switch that turns on anthocyanin production in the fruit.” Martin noted that while there are other tomato varieties that look purple, they have anthocyanins only in the skin, so the health benefits are slight. “People say, Oh, there are purple tomatoes already,” Martin said. “But they don’t have these kind of levels.”  The difference is significant. When cancer-prone mice were given Martin’s purple tomatoes as part of their diet, they lived 30 percent longer than mice fed the same quantity of ordinary tomatoes; they were also less susceptible to inflammatory bowel disease. After the publication of Martin’s first paper showing the anticancer benefit of her tomatoes, in the academic journal Nature Biotechnology in 2008, newspapers and television stations began calling. “The coverage!” she recalled. “Days and days and days and days of it! There was a lot of excitement.” She considered making the tomato available in stores or offering it online as a juice. But because the plant contained a pair of genes from a snapdragon — that’s what spurs the tomatoes to produce more anthocyanin — it would be classified as a genetically modified organism: a G.M.O. That designation brings with it a host of obligations, not just in Britain but in the United States and many other countries. Martin had envisioned making the juice on a small scale, but just to go through the F.D.A. approval process would cost a million dollars. Adding U.S.D.A. approval could push that amount even higher. (Tomato juice is known as a “G.M. product” and is regulated by the F.D.A. Because a tomato has seeds that can germinate, it is regulated by both the F.D.A. and the U.S.D.A.) “I thought, This is ridiculous,” Martin told me. Martin eventually did put together the required documentation, but the process, and subsequent revisions, took almost six years. “Our ‘business model’ is that we have this tiny company which has no employees,” Martin said with a laugh. “Of course, the F.D.A. is used to the bigger organizations” — global agricultural conglomerates like DowDuPont or Syngenta — “so this is where you get a bit of a problem. When they say, ‘Oh, we want a bit more data on this,’ it’s easy for a corporation. For me — it’s me that has to do it! And I can’t just throw money at it.” Martin admitted that, as an academic, she hadn’t been as focused on getting the tomato to market as she might have been. (Her colleague Jonathan Jones, a plant biologist, eventually stepped in to assist.) But the process has also been slow because the purple tomato, if approved, would be one of only a very few G.M.O. fruits or vegetables sold directly to consumers. The others include Rainbow papayas, which were modified to resist ringspot virus; a variety of sweet corn; some russet potatoes; and Arctic Apples, which were developed in Canada and resist browning. It also might be the first genetically modified anything that people actually want. Since their introduction in the mid-1990s, G.M.O.s have remained wildly unpopular with consumers, who see them as dubious tools of Big Ag, with potentially sinister impacts on both people and the environment. Martin is perhaps onto something when she describes those most opposed to G.M.O.s as “the W.W.W.s”: the well, wealthy and worried, the same cohort of upper-middle-class shoppers who have turned organic food into a multibillion-dollar industry. “If you’re a W.W.W., the calculation is, G.M.O.s seem bad, so I’m just going to avoid them,” she said. “I mean, if you think there might be a risk, and there’s no benefit to you, why even consider it?” The purple tomato could perhaps change that calculation. Unlike commercial G.M.O. crops — things like soy and canola — Martin’s tomato wasn’t designed for profit and would be grown in small batches rather than on millions of acres: essentially the opposite of industrial agriculture. The additional genes it contains (from the snapdragon, itself a relative of the tomato plant) act only to boost production of anthocyanin, a nutrient that tomatoes already make. More important, the fruit’s anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties, which seem considerable, are things that many of us actively want. Nonetheless, the future of the purple tomato is far from certain. “There’s just so much baggage around anything genetically modified,” Martin said. “I’m not trying to make money. I’m worried about people’s health! But in people’s minds it’s all Dr. Frankenstein and trying to rule the world.” In the three decades since G.M.O. crops were introduced, only a tiny number have been developed and approved for sale, almost all of them products made by large agrochemical companies like Monsanto. Within those categories, though, G.M.O.s have taken over much of the market. Roughly 94 percent of soybeans grown in the United States are genetically modified, as is more than 90 percent of all corn, canola and sugar beets, together covering roughly 170 million acres of cropland. At the same time, resistance to G.M.O. foods has only become more entrenched. The market for products certified to be non-G.M.O. has increased more than 70-fold since 2010, from roughly $350 million that year to $26 billion by 2018. There are now more than 55,000 products carrying the “Non-G.M.O. Project Verified” label on their packaging. Nearly half of all U.S. shoppers say that they try not to buy G.M.O. foods, while a study by Jennifer Kuzma, a biochemist who is a director of the Genetic Engineering and Society Center at North Carolina State University, found that consumers will pay up to 20 percent more to avoid them. For many of us, the rejection of G.M.O.s is instinctive. “For people who are uncomfortable with this, the objection is that it isn’t something that would ever happen in nature,” says Alan Levinovitz, a professor of religion and science at James Madison University. “With genetic engineering, there’s a feeling that we’re mucking about with the essential building blocks of reality. We may feel OK about rearranging genes, the way nature does, but we’re not comfortable mixing them up between creatures.” Our distrust might also stem from the way G.M.O.s were introduced. When the agribusiness giant Monsanto released its first G.M.O. crop in 1996 — an herbicide-resistant soybean — the company was in need of cash. By adding a gene from a bacterium, it hoped to create crops that were resistant to glyphosate, the active ingredient in its trademark herbicide, RoundUp, enabling farmers to spray weeds liberally without also killing the soy plant itself — something that wasn’t possible with traditional herbicides. Commercially, the idea succeeded. By 2003, RoundUp Ready corn and soy seeds dominated the market, and Monsanto had become the largest producer of genetically engineered seeds, responsible for more than 90 percent of G.M.O. crops planted globally. But the company’s rollout also alarmed and antagonized farmers, who were required to sign restrictive contracts to use the patented seeds, and whom Monsanto aggressively prosecuted. At one point, the company had a 75-person team dedicated solely to investigating farmers suspected of saving seed — a traditional practice in which seeds from one year’s crop are saved for planting the following year — and prosecuting them on charges of intellectual-property infringement. Environmental groups were also concerned, because of the skyrocketing use of RoundUp and the abrupt decline in agricultural diversity. “It was kind of a perfect storm,” says Mark Lynas, an environmental writer and activist who protested against G.M.O.s for over a decade. “You had this company that had made Agent Orange and PCBs” — an environmental toxin that the E.P.A. banned in 1979 — “that was now using G.M.O.s to intensify the worst forms of monoculture farming. I just remember feeling like we had to stop this thing.” That resistance was compounded because early G.M.O.s — which focused largely on pest- and herbicide-resistance — offered little direct benefit to the consumer. And once public sentiment was set, it proved hard to shift, even when more beneficial products began to emerge. One of these, Golden Rice, was made in 1999 by a pair of university researchers hoping to combat vitamin A deficiency, a simple but devastating ailment that causes blindness in millions of people in Africa and Asia annually, and that can also be fatal. But the project foundered after protests by anti-G.M.O. activists in the United States and Europe, which in turn alarmed governments and populations in developing countries. “Probably the angriest I’ve ever felt was when anti-G.M.O. groups destroyed fields of Golden Rice growing in the Philippines,” says Lynas, who publicly disavowed his opposition to G.M.O.s in 2013. “To see a crop that had such obvious lifesaving potential ruined — it would be like anti-vaxxer groups invading a laboratory and destroying a million vials of Covid vaccine.” In recent years, many environmental groups have also quietly walked back their opposition as evidence has mounted that existing G.M.O.s are both safe to eat and not inherently bad for the environment. The introduction of Bt corn, which contains a gene from Bacillus thuringiensis, a naturally insect-resistant bacterium that organic farmers routinely spray on crops, dropped the crop’s insecticide use by 35 percent. A pest-resistant Bt eggplant has become similarly popular in Bangladesh, where farmers have also embraced flood-tolerant “scuba rice,” a variety engineered to survive being submerged for up to 14 days rather than just three. Each year, Bangladesh and India lose roughly four million tons of rice to flooding — enough to feed 30 million people — and waste a corresponding volume of pesticides and herbicides, which then enter the groundwater. In North America, though, such benefits can seem remote compared with what we think of as “eating naturally.” That’s especially true because, for many of us, G.M.O.s and the harms of industrial agriculture (monocultures, overuse of pesticides and herbicides) remain inextricably linked. “Because of the way that G.M.O.s were introduced to the public — as a corporate product, focused on profit — the whole technology got tarred,” Lynas says. “In people’s minds it’s ‘Genetic engineering equals monoculture equals the broken food system.’ But it doesn’t have to be that way.” The greenhouse where Martin grows her tomatoes is surprisingly modest: a small and somewhat grubby building filled with leggy plants in plastic pots. Martin often has multiple projects going at one time, and as she walked me down the row, she pointed out a (non-G.M.O.) tomato bred to be rich in vitamin D; another with high levels of resveratrol, the antioxidant compound in red wine; and one that a postdoc, Eugenio Butelli, is trying to modify to produce serotonin, a neurotransmitter used in antidepressant drugs. When I asked whether antidepressant tomatoes were next, Martin shrugged. “He’s playing,” she said. “A lot of what we do is play.” Even if the serotonin-producing tomatoes proved possible, she added, they wouldn’t be sold in grocery stores but would simply be added to the growing list of “biologics”: plants or bacteria that have been genetically engineered to produce the active ingredient in medications, including ones for diabetes, breast cancer and arthritis. Martin herself recently created a tomato that produces levodopa, the primary drug for treating Parkinson’s disease, in hopes of making the drug both more affordable and more tolerable. (The synthetic version of levodopa can cause nausea and other side effects, and it also costs about $2 a day — more than some patients, especially those in developing countries, can afford.) Farther down the row was the next-generation purple tomato: a dark blue-black variety called Indigo that Martin has created by crossing the high-anthocyanin purple tomato with a yellow one high in flavonols, an anti-inflammatory compound found in things like kale and green tea, making it even richer in antioxidants. The Indigo, which is also a G.M.O., is too new to have been evaluated for health benefits, but Martin is hopeful that it will have even more robust health effects than the purple tomato. One pot over, Martin stopped at a purple-​tomato plant hung with a single luscious cluster of fruit. “There’s a lovely one,” Martin said, picking it gently and brushing off a few white flecks. “Interestingly, the high-anthocyanin tomatoes also have an extended shelf life. We’re not sure why, but they seem to be more resistant to fungal infection, which is what causes tomatoes to rot.” Such unanticipated genetic changes can cut both ways, of course. In 1996, researchers determined that soybeans containing a gene from a Brazil nut could trigger a reaction in someone who is allergic. (The soybeans were experimental and never intended for the market.) Likewise, instead of lasting longer, Martin’s tomato could have turned mealy or become more bitter. Theoretically, it could even have become dangerous. Had Martin added genes that increased production of solanine — a toxic chemical produced by plants in the nightshade family, including tomatoes and potatoes — the resulting fruit could have been lethal. For anyone wondering, I sampled Martin’s purple and Indigo tomatoes, and eating them has so far not had any alarming effects, at least that I can detect. But of course, I can’t say for sure. What if genetically modified produce turns out to have delayed or unpredictable consequences for our health? Something we can’t easily observe or test for, or perhaps even detect until it’s too late? The fear of such unforeseen effects — what Kuzma calls “unknowingness” — is perhaps consumers’ biggest concern when it comes to G.M.O.s. Genetic interactions, after all, are famously complex. Adding a new gene — or simply changing how a gene is regulated (i.e., how active it is) — rarely affects just a single thing. Moreover, our understanding of these interactions, and their effects, is constantly evolving. Megan Westgate, executive director of the Non-G.M.O. Project, echoed this point. “Anyone who knows about genetics knows that there’s a lot we don’t understand,” Westgate says. “We’re always discovering new things or finding out that things we believed aren’t actually right.” Charles Benbrook, executive director of the Heartland Health Research Alliance, also notes that any potential health impacts from G.M.O.s would be stronger in whole foods — produce we consume raw, unprocessed and in large amounts — than in ingredients like corn syrup. Despite that, plant geneticists tend not to be overly concerned about the risks of G.M.O.s, as long as the modifications are made with some care. As a 2016 report by the National Academy of Sciences found, G.M.O.s were generally safe, though it allowed that minor impacts were theoretically possible. Fred Gould, a professor of agriculture who was chairman of the committee that prepared the 600-page report, noted that genetic changes that alter a metabolic pathway — the cellular process that transforms biochemical elements into a particular nutrient or compound, like the anthocyanins in Martin’s tomato — were especially important to study because they could cause cascading effects. Gould likened these pathways to the plumbing in a house. If a genetic edit shuts off one pipe — say one that generates a bitter compound — the building blocks for that compound will start flowing elsewhere, the way a blocked pipe will force water into neighboring channels. The results of this redirection, Gould told me, are poorly understood. “Do the extra precursor chemicals end up producing more of something else?” Gould asked. “Or do they just stay as precursors? For some pathways, plant biologists know the answer. But in other cases we don’t.” But he also noted that this problem wasn’t unique to G.M.O.s. Years ago, for instance, farmers crossbred cucumbers to reduce the amount of cucurbitacin (a bitter compound that repels spider mites) in the peel. But because those cucumbers were made with conventional breeding, growers weren’t required to sequence the genome of the new variety, or even to look at its nutritional and toxicity profile, as they would with something genetically engineered. “We’ve never really asked a conventional breeder: ‘Hey, when you turn off the production of cucurbitacin by crossbreeding, does something else get produced?’” Gould added. “Or do the levels of other important compounds go up or down?” Gould emphasized that many genetic modifications to food are trivial and extremely unlikely to have any measurable effect on people. And even the effects of precursor changes would mostly be slight. “I mean, we’ve been changing all these things already with conventional breeding, and so far we’re doing all right,” he added. “Making the same change with genetic engineering — there’s really no difference.” If we don’t find these sorts of distinctions very reassuring, it’s in part because our extravagant concern about G.M.O.s reflects something more fundamental: the fact that most of us don’t really understand how genes work. As several scientists I spoke with pointed out, a gene is just a narrow set of biological instructions, many of which appear across a wide range of species. The snapdragon gene in Martin’s tomato, for instance, is known as a transcription factor: essentially, a kind of volume knob that regulates how much of something a particular gene will produce. That something could be anthocyanin, or it could be a dangerous toxin, but the knob itself isn’t the problem, nor is the process by which it was added. “For the majority of people, the anxiety around G.M.O.s is almost entirely untethered to an understanding of what’s happening at a scientific level,” Levinovitz says. “But that actually makes the anxiety harder to address, rather than easier.” This is particularly true around food. Whether or not people actually understand where their fruits and vegetables come from, Levinovitz says, we think that we do — and are disturbed when that changes. The philosophical term for this is epistemic opacity. “When you imagine you know how something works, or where it comes from, that’s comforting,” he added. “So when you hear that an apple was genetically modified, it’s like, What does that mean? It’s alienating.” For many consumers, Levinovitz notes, the word “natural” has become a heuristic: a mental shortcut for deciding if something is good or safe. “We hear it all the time, and it is often true. Why do we have chronic pain? Because we weren’t meant to sit at a desk for hours. Why is the sea turtle not reproducing? Because of the artificial light we introduced on beaches. It’s not a very consistent view” — there are all kinds of unnatural things that nobody worries about, like Netflix and indoor plumbing — “but it’s become a kind of shorthand for this world we feel like we’ve lost.” In practice, of course, almost everything we grow and eat today has had its DNA altered extensively. For millenniums, farmers, discovering that one version of a plant — usually a random genetic mutant — was hardier, or sweeter, or had smaller seeds, would cross it with another that, say, produced more fruit, in hopes of getting both benefits. But the process was slow. Simply changing the color of a tomato from red to yellow while preserving its other traits could take years of crossbreeding. And tomatoes are one of the easiest cases. Introducing even a minor change to a cherry through crossbreeding, I was told, could take up to 150 years. To those who worry about G.M.O.s, that slowness is reassuring. “There’s a sense that, yes, these things have been altered,” Levinovitz noted. “But they’ve been altered over a very long time, in the same way that nature alters things.” Yet the way nature alters things is also profoundly haphazard. Sometimes a plant will acquire one trait at the expense of another. Sometimes it actually becomes worse. The same is true for agricultural crossbreeding. Not only is there no way to control which genes are kept and which are lost; the process also tends to introduce unwanted changes. The technical term for this is “linkage drag”: all the unintended, and unknown, genes that get pulled along during cross-pollination, like fish in a net. Commercial berry growers spent decades trying to create a domesticated version of the black raspberry through crossbreeding but never succeeded: the thornless berries either tasted worse or produced almost no fruit, or they developed other problems. It’s also why meeting the needs of modern agriculture — growing produce that can be shipped long distances and hold up in the store and at home for more than a few days — can result in tomatoes that taste like cardboard or strawberries that aren’t as sweet as they used to be. “With conventional breeding, you’re basically just shuffling the genetic deck,” the agricultural executive Tom Adams told me. “You’re never going to carry over only the gene you want.” In recent years genetic-engineering tools like CRISPR have offered a way around this imprecision, making it possible to identify which genes control which traits — things like color, hardiness, sweetness — and to change only those. “It’s far more precise,” says Andrew Allan, a plant biologist at the University of Auckland. “Instead of rolling the dice, you’re changing only the thing you want to change. And you can do it in one generation instead of 10 or 20.” Last year, the U.S.D.A. ruled that plants that had undergone simple cisgenic edits — changes to the plant’s own DNA, of the kind that could theoretically be created by years of traditional crossbreeding — would not be subject to the same regulation as other G.M.O.s. And some people are arguing that it’s time to reconsider how G.M.O.s are regulated as well, especially when it comes to small growers like Martin. From a regulatory perspective, Allan pointed out, all G.M.O.s are treated the same, regardless of the modification and regardless of the scale. “Whether you’re a corporation that wants to plant millions of acres of pest-resistant corn or someone who’s made a lovely little tomato that could save lives, it’s all the same process,” he said. Allan noted that his current project, the red flesh apple, contains a single gene taken from a crab apple which increases its antioxidants. “It’s an extremely low-risk change,” he said. “We’re literally just taking a gene from one kind of apple and putting it into another. But it is still, demonstrably, a G.M.O.” The policy is partly a holdover from the early days of genetic engineering, when less was known about the process and its effects. But it has persisted, in part because of powerful anti-G.M.O. campaigning. Eric Ward, co-chief executive of the agricultural technology company AgBiome, described the situation as “stuck in a closed loop.” He went on: “People think, Well, if you’ve got this really strict regulatory system, then it must be really dangerous. So it becomes self-reinforcing.” For Martin, this has created a strange catch-22. Grocery stores are afraid to carry something like a genetically modified tomato because they worry that consumers will reject it. Growers and businesses are afraid of investing in one for the same reason. Genetic engineering, Ward notes, has become far more accessible since the first G.M.O. crops were introduced in the 1990s. “But it’s turned into this thing that only half a dozen companies in the world can afford to do, because they’ve got to go through all this regulatory stuff.” He paused. “It’s ironic. The activists that first objected to G.M.O.s did it because they didn’t trust big agribusiness. But the result now is that only big companies can afford to do it.” A few days before traveling to Norwich, I joined Martin at the Royal Society in London for the Future Food conference, a series of talks on genetic engineering in agriculture. There I met Haven Baker, a founder of a company called Pairwise, which was started to create fruits and vegetables that are genetically edited but not G.M.O.“I don’t think we can change people’s minds about G.M.O.s,” Baker said. “But gene editing is a clean slate. And maybe then G.M.O.s will be able to follow.” In his talk, Baker noted that there are hundreds of kinds of berries in the world. But among those we commonly call berries, we eat just four: strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and blackberries. There’s a reason the other varieties rarely reach us. Sometimes the fruit rots within days after picking (salmonberries), or the plant puts out fruit for only a few weeks in summer (cloudberries). Sometimes the plant doesn’t produce much fruit at all or is too thorny or sprawling for the fruit to be picked without a vast amount of labor. As Joel Reiner, a horticulturalist at Pairwise, would later put it, “Berries always have some tragic flaw.” Black raspberries, one fruit that Pairwise hopes to bring to market, used to be widely grown in North America, until a virus decimated them. (The red raspberries we eat now originally came from Turkey.) The revived version, which will be in field trials in 2024, has been engineered to be thornless and seedless, while retaining the fruit’s signature jammy flavor. More recently, the company began a similar project with vegetables. Baker says that we underestimate the mediocrity of most grocery-store produce, which tends to be tasteless and also offers little in the way of novelty. On top of that, most vegetables just aren’t very appealing, especially compared with processed foods. Vegetables take work to prepare, vary in quality and can be bitter or woody. They’re also perishable, often going bad before we get around to cooking them. “Especially if you’re on a budget, you hate the idea of wasting food,” Megan Thomas, one of Baker’s colleagues, noted. “You buy processed food, you can put it in the freezer or in the pantry for eight months and not worry about it.” These drawbacks have affected our diet. Only 10 percent of Americans eat the U.S. recommended daily allowance of fruit and vegetables, and teenagers eat even less. And that isn’t because the standard is particularly high: In an entire year, the average American consumes just a few heads of broccoli. “So how do we change that?” Baker asked. “People already know that they’re supposed to be eating vegetables. They just aren’t doing it. But if we can use gene editing to make broccoli slightly less bitter, maybe people — and especially kids — will eat more of it, and therefore be getting more fiber and more vitamins. Which might make a difference in their long-term health.” Not long after the conference, I flew to North Carolina to meet with Baker and his co-founder, Tom Adams. Before starting Pairwise, Baker and Adams each worked at large companies that invested in G.M.O. crops: Adams at Monsanto and Baker at Simplot, where he oversaw the development of a potato that produces less acrylamide, a carcinogen, when fried. (Monsanto, which is now owned by Bayer, provided some of the initial funding for Pairwise and retains the option to commercialize any innovation in row crops, though not in consumer produce.) Pairwise’s office is in an airy former textile mill that also houses a yoga studio, a tattoo parlor and several artist studios. When I showed up in February 2020, the area was just recovering from a winter storm that brought snow and black ice. Inside the greenhouses, though, it was warm and humid. “It’s a great place to work in the winter,” said Reiner, who tends to Pairwise’s plants. “In the summer it can get rough.” In anticipation of my visit, Reiner had set up samples from the company’s “superfood greens project,” which he described as creating “something that’s essentially lettuce but healthier.” Baker noted that Americans trying to eat well often order salads, but around half of those are made with iceberg or romaine lettuce, which have few nutrients and very little fiber. “If those empty leaves could be swapped for a healthy green, it would be a big nutrition boost,” he said. The problem is that nobody really likes the taste of healthy greens. “Do you want to guess what percent of the leafy green market is kale?” Baker asked at one point. “From what we can gather, it’s about 6 and a half percent. And the thing is, kale is known to be extremely good for you. It’s very rich in fiber and micronutrients: vitamins and minerals. But people don’t like to eat it.” In theory, gene editing could change that. Pairwise’s initial lettuce alternative, mustard greens, are in the same family as kale, Reiner explained, and have better nutritional value. But they’re extremely pungent, a trait the company hopes to minimize. For the tasting, Reiner laid out two varieties of genetically altered mustard greens. The first was beautiful: a dark green leaf veined with red, like a miniature chard. The edited version tasted extremely mild — perfect for salad — but when Reiner talked with consumer researchers, they complained that the leaves were too red. (“It’s OK to have a little bit of red, like some leaf lettuces,” Reiner explained. “But people expect most of what they see in the bag to be green.”) The second variety was more recognizable: a big, frilly, light green leaf that resembled the mustard greens I often buy — and then fail to eat — from the farmers’ market. That version was also extremely, almost inedibly, strong. Just nibbling the edge of a leaf cleared my sinuses like eating wasabi. “The compound that you’re tasting is called allyl isothiocyanate,” Reiner said as I dabbed at my watering eyes. “It’s not made until you chew it. The plant contains both the enzyme and the compound that converts it — but it holds them separate. When you chew, they combine to make something that tastes like horseradish. That’s why you have that little delay when you first bite into it, before it hits you.” By comparison, the genetically edited version was delightful, if almost unrecognizable: mild to the point of sweetness, with a pleasant, springy texture. It also has the advantage of looking more like romaine lettuce, and with its larger size and greater frilliness, it does a better job, as Reiner puts it, of “filling up the plate.” It seemed like something that I would happily eat, and in the months after the tasting, as I slogged through my usual salads, I found myself looking forward to the day when I could buy Pairwise’s mustard greens. I liked the idea of getting all that extra nutrition — the vitamins, the fiber — without the punishing pungency. But I also found myself worrying. If I got used to eating greens that were genetically edited to be milder, would I lose my tolerance for funkier ones, like bitter rapini or peppery radishes? At what point would I not want to eat even the local greens from the farmers’ market? After Baker’s talk at the Future Food conference, a member of the audience voiced the same concern: He was terrified, he said, by the prospect of using genetic engineering to “change what is natural just to meet people’s taste.” Rather than bending the natural world to our palates, shouldn’t we be adapting ourselves to the world? I put this question to Heather Hudson, who oversees Pairwise’s vegetable projects. Hudson smiled grimly. Modifying people’s taste, she said, is extremely difficult. An individual might manage it, by training her palate to appreciate, say, the slight bitterness of radicchio, but as a public health strategy it’s essentially hopeless. “I actually started out in nutrition, hoping to change how people ate,” Hudson went on. “But changing people’s behavior is hard.” There’s also a big difference between what we virtuously say we want and what we actually buy, let alone consume. This disconnect is something that Baker has thought about as well. With berries, Baker noted: “People definitely like them better when they’re sweeter. They don’t want sour berries, they want sweet berries!” From a purchasing perspective, he added, berries are in competition with “cheap sugar”: candies and cookies. “So, then you ask, should we even be editing these berries to make them sweeter? Have we then made these healthy berries more like candy?” He shook his head. “But the flip side is I don’t see us making progress on fruits and vegetables if we don’t make them more palatable at some level.” For all of Pairwise’s innovations, there’s a significant limit to how much a plant can be altered without making it a G.M.O. Insect-resistant crops like Bt corn and eggplant, for instance, rely on a gene from a bacterium; neither plant has a gene capable of performing the same function. Even Martin’s purple tomato would have been harder to make without using the transcription factor from snapdragons — although it would theoretically be possible. In general, it’s easy to stop an existing gene from functioning, but much harder to use gene editing to add a new trait or function. If Pairwise’s fruits and vegetables succeed with consumers, they will almost certainly open the door to other produce made through various kinds of genetic engineering. But getting shoppers to trust that these products are safe requires building confidence in how they’re regulated. “For a G.M.O., you’d want to ask: Is there anything in this which is toxic? Are there any novel proteins, or anything else potentially allergenic?” Lynas says. “And you’d do a compositional analysis. It’s basic food-safety stuff, really.” Gould and his co-authors on the National Academy of Sciences report have floated a more meticulous alternative: Researchers would compare the chemical and nutritional profiles of a genetically modified fruit or vegetable against existing varieties we’re already eating. “We have technologies now that allow you to check thousands of traits, to see if anything has changed,” Gould told me. “Why not use them to look at whether, you know, the vitamin C content in the orange you’ve made has gone down or stayed the same?” Should these sorts of comparisons become standard, they could determine, at a molecular level, whether there’s a measurable difference between the tomatoes and apples we’re already eating and the genetically modified version. Paradoxically, these comparisons might also reveal just how much ordinary breeding has already done to create the very changes we fear that G.M.O.s introduce: lowering a vegetable’s nutritional value, say, or increasing an allergen or invisibly altering the biochemical makeup of a plant in ways that could affect our long-term health. Conversely, they may show that G.M.O.s are just as safe, if not safer, than foods that have been altered more conventionally. Providing such safeguards for G.M.O. fruits and vegetables should be reassuring. But just as someone who distrusts vaccines tends to persist in that belief even when presented with abundant evidence of safety and efficacy, those who distrust G.M.O.s are unlikely to change their views until there’s a pressing reason. One possibly persuasive factor is climate change. As Allan notes, the global population is only increasing: By 2050, it will have gone up by two billion, and all those people need to be fed. “So where’s that extra food going to come from?” Allan says. “It can’t come from using more land, because if we use more land, then we’ve got to deforest more, and the temperature goes up even more. So what we really need is more productivity. And that, in all likelihood, will require G.M.O.s.” Others believe that we’ll embrace G.M.O.s only when the alternative is to lose something we value. For years, the Florida citrus industry has been plagued by “citrus greening,” a bacterial disease that is currently being controlled — with limited success — by sprayed antibiotics and pesticides. “If it comes down to buying orange juice that’s G.M.O., or not buying any orange juice, what are you going to choose?” the grower Harry Klee told me. “It’s the same thing that happened with the papaya in Hawaii. At some point, the consumer is going to have to decide what really matters to them.” One of those things might be the very biodiversity that G.M.O.s have helped diminish. As agriculture has industrialized, genetic diversity has shrunk profoundly, with monocultures (or a limited number of hardy varieties) replacing what was once a cornucopia of wild varieties. One study found that before G.M.O.s were even introduced, we’d lost 93 percent of the genetic diversity in our fruits and vegetables. In the early 1900s, farmers in Iowa regularly grew pink-fleshed Chelsea watermelons, which were known for being intensely sweet but have now all but disappeared because they’re too delicate for shipping. Blenheim apricots, once widely cultivated in California, have a sublime, honeyed flavor and a delicate blush-mottled skin, but also bruise easily and ripen from the inside out, confusing consumers. As a result, fresh Blenheims are now almost impossible to find, even though, as the food writer Russ Parsons put it, they’re the apricot that “reminds you of what that fruit is supposed to taste like.” Genetic engineering and G.M.O.s could help undo these losses, restoring rare and delicate heirloom varieties that were once abundant but have now all but disappeared. One appealing vision is for small growers and academics to figure out what tiny modification would make Blenheims slightly more durable, while preserving everything else about the texture and flavor. While the apricot will most likely never be hardy or controllable enough for mass production, it might be made sturdy enough to allow small producers to plant an orchard that’s sustainable. It’s not just the most fragile fruits that we’re losing — or may soon lose. Cherries, for instance, are highly sensitive to rain and frost, a problem that makes them especially vulnerable to climate change. They’re also extremely seasonal, ripening all at once over the span of just a few weeks, rather than growing year-round. Faced with labor shortages and shrinking profits, some growers have begun talking about converting their cherry orchards to apples, which keep better and are less risky. To prevent that from happening, Hudson suggested that cherries could be made easier to pick, and perhaps grown year-round, like blueberries (which until recently were also highly seasonal). “Doing that means the farmer gets stability, and the workers get stability,” she added. But we’re unlikely to see these kinds of projects while G.M.O.s remain the exclusive product of global agrochemical companies. While a researcher at an agricultural college might be interested in bringing back the Blenheim — or creating a wonderful new antioxidant tomato — the financial payoff is nonexistent. “Imagine you’re a big company,” says Ward, the AgBiome chief executive. “You can put a dollar into an insect-control trait in soybean and bring in 10 to 15 billion dollars. Or you can put a dollar into a healthier tomato that at peak might be worth a few million dollars. It’s pretty simple financial calculation.” There are some signs that the future of small-scale, bespoke G.M.O. produce may already have begun. In late April, Cathie Martin told me that the U.S.D.A. had recently updated its regulations to allow more G.M.O. plants to be grown outside, without a three-year field trial or in tightly contained greenhouses. (The exceptions are plants or organisms with the potential to be a pest, pathogen or weed.) In the wake of this change, Martin and Jones are planning to make the purple tomato available first to home gardeners, who could grow it from seed as soon as next spring — well before the commercially grown tomato reaches grocery stores. (U.S.D.A. approval is expected by December.) They’re currently testing six different varieties, to find the most flavorful. “When we first developed the purple tomato, it was home gardeners who were most interested in it,” Martin noted. “And with home gardening, it’s an opt-in system. It’s up to you whether you want to grow it.” It was an intriguing idea. Months earlier, while browsing a website called The Garden Professors, I noticed that a home gardener named Janet Chennault had posted a query asking where she could buy G.M.O. seeds. Others had wondered the same thing. “I would love to try some G.M. vegetable seeds in my garden,” a woman named Lorrie Delehanty said. After some searching, I managed to track down Delehanty, who had recently retired and was living in Charlottesville, Va. Over the phone, she described herself as having “a little tiny backyard in the middle of the city” that she and her husband had worked hard to homestead, planting blackberries along the fence line and creating a bird sanctuary around the vegetable plot. She was interested in G.M. seeds, she said, because she did her own canning and freezing, “and I’m always looking to grow something different.” When I asked what kind of thing she was looking for, Delehanty grew animated. “Something with the sweet, smoky flavor of a scorpion pepper without the screaming heat,” she began. “Also potatoes that resist bacterial scab. I’m sick and tired of getting scabby potatoes. The purple tomato — I would try that in a heartbeat.” She paused. “Oh, and bigger blackberries!” Jennifer Kahn is a contributing writer for the magazine and the narrative-program lead at the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley.
