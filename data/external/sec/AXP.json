      "item1a":"This section highlights specific risks that could affect us and our businesses. You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of\nthe other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on the information currently known to us, we believe the following\ninformation identifies the most significant risk factors affecting us. However, the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described\nbelow. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our\nbusiness.\nIf any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events or if the circumstances described in the risks and uncertainties occur\nor continue to occur, these events or circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThese events could also have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities.\nStrategic, Business and Competitive Risks\nDifficult economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions, both in the United States and elsewhere around the world. Uncertain\nexpectations for global economic growth have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on us, in part because we are very dependent upon\nthe level of consumer and business activity and the demand for credit and payment products. A prolonged period of slow economic growth or\ndeterioration in economic conditions could change customer behaviors, including spending on our cards and the ability and willingness of Card\nMembers to pay amounts owed to us. Travel expenditures are sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels and also tend to\ndecline during general economic downturns. Further, economic instability in certain regions or countries could negatively affect consumer and\nbusiness spending in other parts of the world. If economic conditions were to worsen, we could experience adverse effects on our results of\noperations and financial condition.\nFactors such as consumer spending, business investment, government spending, interest rates, tax rates, fuel and other energy costs, the\nvolatility and strength of the capital markets, inflation and deflation all affect the economic environment and, ultimately, our profitability. While the\nrecent drop in oil prices may be beneficial for the U.S. economy overall, it has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, the\namount of gas spending on our cards. An economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower consumer\nspending, lower demand for credit, lower corporate earnings or lower business investment is likely to materially and adversely affect our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, such factors may cause our earnings, credit metrics and margins to fluctuate and diverge\nfrom expectations of analysts and investors, who may have differing assumptions regarding their impact on our business, adversely affecting the\ntrading price of our common shares.\nOur operating results may suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payments industry.\nThe payments industry is highly competitive, and we compete with a wide variety of financial payment products, including charge, credit and\ndebit card networks and issuers, paper-based transactions (e.g., cash and checks), bank transfer models (e.g., wire transfers and ACH), as well as\nevolving alternative payment mechanisms, systems and products, such as aggregators and web-based payment platforms (e.g., PayPal, Square\nand Amazon), wireless payment technologies (including using mobile telephone networks to carry out transactions), virtual currencies, prepaid\nsystems, gift cards, mobile payments, blockchain and similar distributed ledger technologies, and other systems linked to payment cards or that\nprovide payment solutions. We also compete with technology companies, telecommunication providers, handset manufacturers, large retailers and\nretailer coalitions that are seeking to integrate more financial services into their product offerings.\nWe are the fourth largest general-purpose card network on a global basis based on purchase volume, behind China UnionPay, Visa and\nMasterCard and. We believe Visa and MasterCard are larger than we are in most countries. As a result, competitive card issuers and acquirers on\nthe Visa and MasterCard networks may be able to benefit from the dominant position, scale, resources, marketing and pricing of Visa and\nMasterCard.\nSome of our competitors have developed, or may develop, substantially greater financial and other resources than we have, including larger\ncash reserves, may offer a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective advertising, marketing or cross-selling\nstrategies to achieve broader brand recognition, cobrand card\n33\nTable of Contents\nprograms or merchant acceptance than we have. We may not be able to compete effectively against these threats or respond or adapt to changes in\nconsumer spending habits as effectively as our competitors.\nSpending on our cards could continue to be impacted by increasing consumer usage of debit cards issued on competitive networks, as well as\nadoption of payment systems based on ACH or other payment mechanisms. To the extent alternative payment mechanisms, systems and products\ncontinue to successfully expand, our discount revenues and our ability to access transaction data through our closed-loop network could be\nnegatively impacted. If we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors, drive value for our customers and/or effectively grow in areas\nsuch as mobile and online payments, fee-based services and emerging technologies, we may not be able to compete effectively against these\nthreats.\nTo the extent we expand into new business areas and new geographic regions, we may face competitors with more experience and more\nestablished relationships with relevant customers, regulators and industry participants, which could adversely affect our ability to compete. We may\nface additional compliance and regulatory risk to the extent that we expand into new business areas and we may need to dedicate more expense,\ntime and resources to comply with regulatory requirements than our competitors, particularly those that are not regulated financial institutions. In\naddition, companies that control access to consumer and merchant payment method preferences through digital wallets, mobile applications or at\nthe point of sale could choose not to accept or could suppress use of our products or could restrict our access to our customers and transaction\ndata. Such companies could also require payments from us to participate in such digital wallets and applications, impacting our profitability on\ntransactions. Laws and business practices that favor local competitors, require card transactions to be routed over domestic networks or prohibit or\nlimit foreign ownership of certain businesses could slow our growth in international regions. Further, expanding our service offerings, adding\ncustomer acquisition channels and forming new partnerships could have higher cost structures than our current arrangements, adversely impact our\naverage discount rate or dilute our brand.\nMany of our competitors are subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes. More restrictive laws\nand regulations that do not apply to all of our competitors can put us at a competitive disadvantage, including prohibiting us from engaging in certain\ntransactions, regulating our contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance or adversely affecting our cost structure. See “\nOngoing legal proceedings regarding provisions in our merchant contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, result in additional\nlitigation and/or arbitrations, subject us to substantial monetary damages and damage our reputation and brand ” for a discussion of the potential\nimpact on our ability to compete effectively if ongoing legal proceedings limit our ability to prevent merchants from engaging in various actions to\ndiscriminate against our card products.\nWe face continued intense competitive pressure that may impact the prices we charge merchants that accept our cards for payment for\ngoods and services.\nUnlike our competitors in the payments industry that rely on high revolving credit balances to drive profits, our business model is focused on\nCard Member spending. Discount revenue, which represents fees generally charged to merchants when Card Members use their cards to purchase\ngoods and services on our network, is primarily driven by billed business volumes and is our largest single revenue source. In recent years, we\nexperienced some reduction in our global weighted average merchant discount rate and have been under increasing market pressure, including\npressure created by regulatory-mandated reductions to competitors’ pricing, to reduce merchant discount rates and undertake other repricing\ninitiatives. We also face pressure from competitors that have other sources of income or lower expense bases that can make their pricing more\nattractive to key business partners and merchants. Merchants are also able to negotiate incentives and pricing concessions from us as a condition to\naccepting our cards. As merchants consolidate and become even larger, we may have to increase the amount of incentives and/or concessions we\nprovide to certain merchants, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing\ncould make it difficult to offset the costs of these incentives.\nIn addition, differentiated payment models and technologies from non-traditional players in the alternative payments space and the regulatory\nand litigation environment could pose challenges to our traditional payment model and adversely impact our average discount rate. Some merchants\nalso continue to invest in their own payment solutions, such as proprietary-branded mobile wallets and the CurrentC app on the Merchant Customer\nExchange, using both traditional and new technology platforms. If merchants are able to drive broad consumer adoption and usage, it could\nadversely impact our merchant discount rate and billed business volumes.\nA continuing priority of ours is to drive greater and differentiated value to our merchants, which, if not successful, could negatively impact our\ndiscount revenue and financial results. If we continue to experience a decline in the average merchant discount rate, we will need to find ways to\noffset the financial impact by increasing billed business volumes, increasing other sources of revenue, such as fee-based revenue or interest\nincome, or both. We may not succeed in sustaining merchant discount rates or offsetting the impact of declining merchant discount rates, particularly\nin the current regulatory environment, which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability, and therefore our ability to invest in\ninnovation and in value-added services to merchants and Card Members.\n34\nTable of Contents\nAn increasing prevalence of surcharging by merchants could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn certain countries, such as Australia and certain Member States in the EU, merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases. The\nnumber of countries in the EU that permit surcharging and the potential for selective surcharging of American Express cards only could increase\nfollowing adoption of new EU-wide regulation, as discussed in “Global Network & Merchant Services — Regulation.” In Australia, we have seen\nincreasing merchant surcharging on American Express cards in certain merchant categories and, in some cases, on a basis that is greater than that\napplied to cards issued on the bankcard networks, which is known as differential surcharging.\nIf surcharging becomes widespread, American Express cards and credit and charge cards generally could become less desirable to\nconsumers, which could result in a decrease in cards-in-force and transaction volumes. The impact could vary depending on the manner in which a\nsurcharge is levied and whether surcharges are levied upon all payment cards, whether debit cards are excluded, or whether the amount of the\nsurcharge varies depending on the card, network, acquirer or issuer. Surcharging could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations, particularly to the extent surcharging disproportionately impacts our Card Members through differential\nsurcharging or otherwise.\nIf we are not able to invest successfully in, and compete at the leading edge of, technological developments across all our businesses,\nour revenue and profitability could be negatively affected.\nOur industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes. In order to compete in our industry, we need to continue to invest in\nbusiness process and technology advances across all areas of our business, including in transaction processing, data management and analysis,\ncustomer interactions and communications, alternative payment mechanisms and risk management and compliance systems. Incorporating new\ntechnologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures and take considerable time, and ultimately may not be successful.\nWe expect that new technologies in the payments industry will continue to emerge, and these new technologies may be superior to, or render\nobsolete, the technologies we currently use in our products and services.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to innovate by offering new payment services products, develop new technologies and adapt to\ntechnological changes and evolving industry standards. Consumer and merchant adoption is a key competitive factor and our competitors may\ndevelop products, platforms or technologies that become more widely adopted than ours. If we are unable to continue to keep pace with innovation,\nmanage the shift to mobile, device-based and multi-channel commerce, drive adoption of new products and services or improve the quality of the\nCard Member experience, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to develop, acquire or access competitive technologies or business processes on acceptable terms may also be limited by\nintellectual property rights that third parties, including competitors and potential competitors, may assert. In addition, our ability to adopt new\ntechnologies may be inhibited by a need for industry-wide standards, a changing legislative and regulatory environment, the need for internal product\nand engineering expertise, resistance to change from Card Members or merchants, or the complexity of our systems.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to promote card usage through our marketing, promotion, merchant acceptance and rewards\nprograms, or to effectively control the costs of such programs, both of which may impact our profitability.\nIncreasing consumer and business spending on our cards and growing card lending balances depend in part on our ability to develop and\nissue new or enhanced cards and increase revenues from such products. If customers do not perceive our new offerings as providing significant\nvalue, they may fail to accept our new products and services, which would negatively impact our results of operations. Increasing spending on our\ncards also depends on our continued expansion of merchant acceptance of our cards. If the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows or reverses\nitself, our business could suffer.\nOne of the ways in which we attract new Card Members, reduce Card Member attrition and seek to retain or capture a greater share of\ncustomers’ total spending is through our Membership Rewards program, as well as other Card Member benefits. Any significant change in, or failure\nby management to reasonably estimate, actual redemptions of Membership Rewards points and associated redemption costs could adversely affect\nour profitability. In addition, many credit card issuers have instituted rewards and cobrand programs that are similar to ours, and issuers may in the\nfuture institute programs and services that are more attractive than ours.\nWe have been spending at elevated levels on a number of growth initiatives over the past couple years and expect to continue spending at\nsimilar levels in 2016. There can be no assurance that any of our investments to acquire Card Members and increase usage of our cards will be\neffective. We may not be able to cost-effectively manage and expand Card Member benefits, including containing the growth of marketing,\npromotion, rewards and Card Member services expenses in the future. If such expenses continue to increase beyond our expectations, we will need\nto find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing payments volume, increasing other areas of revenues such as fee-based revenues or both.\nWe may not succeed in doing so, particularly in the current regulatory environment.\n35\nTable of Contents\nOur brand and reputation are key assets of our Company, and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace.\nOur brand and its attributes are key assets of ours, and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve, grow and\nleverage the value of our brand. Our ability to attract and retain consumer and small business Card Members and corporate clients is highly\ndependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, merchant acceptance, financial condition and\nother subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters — even if related to seemingly isolated incidents — could erode\ntrust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential Card Members and corporate clients, which could make it difficult for\nus to attract new Card Members and customers and maintain existing ones. Negative public opinion could also result from actual or alleged conduct\nin any number of activities or circumstances, including card practices, regulatory compliance and the use and protection of customer information,\nand from actions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct. Social media channels can also cause rapid, widespread reputational\nharm to our brand.\nOur brand and reputation may also be harmed by actions taken by third parties that are outside our control. For example, any shortcoming of a\nthird-party vendor, merchant acquirer or GNS partner may be attributed by Card Members and merchants to us, thus damaging our reputation and\nbrand value. The lack of acceptance or suppression of card usage by merchants can also negatively impact perceptions of our brand and our\nproducts, lower overall transaction volume and increase the attractiveness of other payments systems. Adverse developments with respect to our\nindustry may also, by association, negatively impact our reputation, or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us.\nFurthermore, as a corporation with headquarters and operations located in the United States, a negative perception of the United States arising from\nits political or other positions could harm the perception of our company and our brand. Although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk\nto our reputation and brand, negative perceptions or publicity could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nIf we cannot successfully execute on our strategy, our business and financial results may be adversely impacted.\nWe may not be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations, which may result in an adverse impact on\nour business and financial results. These strategic initiatives are designed to improve our results of operations and drive long-term shareholder\nvalue, and include: • Growing our Card Member base and merchant network\n• Deepening customer relationships through lending and rewards\n• Increasing our international presence\n• Growing in commercial payments\n• Developing newer, adjacent opportunities like our loyalty coalition business\nThe process of developing new products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex, costly and uncertain, and any\nfailure by us to anticipate customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our ability to compete\neffectively. In addition, we may underestimate the time and expense we must invest in new products and services before they generate material\nrevenues, if at all.\nOur growth strategy also includes the pursuit of new business opportunities and, potentially, acquisitions. However, we may not be able to take\nadvantage of new business opportunities or to identify and secure future acquisition candidates on terms and conditions that are acceptable to us,\nwhich could impair our growth.\nWe also continue to pursue a disciplined expense-management strategy, although there is no guarantee that we will be able to control the\ngrowth of expenses. Expenses incurred in our foreign entities are subject to foreign exchange volatility and may cause our expenses to increase in\nany particular period even if we otherwise achieve cost savings. In addition, compliance, legal and related costs are difficult to predict or control\ngiven the current environment and may vary from period to period. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we have invested and will continue to\ninvest significant additional resources to continue to modify and strengthen our protective security measures, investigate and remediate any\nvulnerabilities of our information systems and infrastructure and develop new technology to mitigate security risks. If we are unable to successfully\nmanage our expenses, our financial results will be negatively affected.\nA significant disruption or breach in the security of our information technology systems or an increase in fraudulent activity using our\ncards could lead to reputational damage to our brand and significant legal, regulatory and financial exposure and could reduce the use\nand acceptance of our charge and credit cards.\nWe and other third parties process, transmit and store account information in connection with our charge and credit cards and prepaid\nproducts, and in the normal course of our business, we collect, analyze and retain significant volumes of certain types of personally identifiable and\nother information pertaining to our customers and employees.\n36\nTable of Contents\nGlobal financial institutions like us have experienced a significant increase in information security risk in recent years and will likely continue to\nbe the target of increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks, including computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, social engineering attacks\n(including phishing), denial of service attacks and security breaches. For example, we and other U.S. financial services providers have been the\ntargets of distributed denial-of-service attacks from sophisticated third parties.\nOur networks and systems are subject to constant attempts to identify and exploit potential vulnerabilities in our operating environment with\nintent to disrupt our business operations and capture various types of information relating to corporate trade secrets, customer information, including\nCard Member and loyalty program account information, employee information and other sensitive business information. There are a number of\nmotivations for cyber threat actors, including criminal activities such as fraud, identity theft and ransom, corporate or nation-state espionage, public\nembarrassment with the intent to cause financial or reputational harm, intent to disrupt information technology systems, and to expose and exploit\npotential security and privacy vulnerabilities in corporate systems and websites. As outsourcing and specialization of functions within the payments\nindustry increase, there are more third parties involved in processing transactions using our cards and there is a risk the confidentiality, privacy\nand/or security of data held by third parties, including merchants that accept our cards and our business partners, may be compromised, which could\nlead to unauthorized transactions on our cards and costs associated with responding to the compromise.\nWe develop and maintain systems and processes aimed at detecting and preventing data breaches and fraudulent activity, which require\nsignificant investment, maintenance and ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and regulatory requirements change and as efforts to\novercome security measures become more sophisticated. Despite our efforts, the possibility of data breaches, malicious social engineering and\nfraudulent or other malicious activities and human error or malfeasance cannot be eliminated entirely, and risks associated with each of these\nremain, including the unauthorized disclosure, release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other\ninformation (including account data information), online accounts and systems. These risks will likely evolve as new technology is deployed. For\nexample, with the increased use of EMV technology, we may see a decrease in traditional fraud risk, but sophisticated fraudsters may develop new\nways to commit fraud and we may see an increase in online fraud.\nOur information technology systems, including our transaction authorization, clearing and settlement systems, and data centers may\nexperience service disruptions or degradation because of technology malfunction, sudden increases in customer transaction volume, natural\ndisasters, accidents, power outages, telecommunications failures, fraud, denial-of-service and other cyber-attacks, terrorism, computer viruses,\nphysical or electronic break-ins, or similar events. Service disruptions could prevent access to our online services and account information,\ncompromise company or customer data, and impede transaction processing and financial reporting. Inadequate infrastructure in lesser developed\ncountries could also result in service disruptions, which could impact our ability to do business in those countries.\nIf our information technology systems experience a significant disruption or breach or if actual or perceived fraud levels or other illegal activities\ninvolving our cards or customer online accounts were to rise due to a data breach at a business partner, merchant or other market participant,\nemployee error, malfeasance or otherwise, it could lead to the loss of data or data integrity, regulatory investigations and intervention (such as\nmandatory card reissuance), increased litigation (including class action litigation), remediation and response costs, greater concerns of customers\nand/or business partners relating to the privacy and security of their data, and reputational and financial damage to our brand, which could reduce\nthe use and acceptance of our cards, and have a material adverse impact on our business. If such disruptions or breaches are not detected\nimmediately, their effect could be compounded. Data breaches and other actual or perceived failures to maintain confidentiality, integrity, privacy\nand/or data protection, including leaked business data, may also disrupt our operations, undermine our competitive advantage through the\ndisclosure of sensitive company information, divert management attention and resources and negatively impact the assessment of us and our\nsubsidiaries by banking regulators and rating agencies.\nSuccessful cyber-attacks or data breaches at other large financial institutions, large retailers or other market participants, whether or not we\nare impacted, could lead to a general loss of customer confidence that could negatively affect us, including harming the market perception of the\neffectiveness of our security measures or the financial system in general, which could result in reduced use of our products and services. Although\nwe have insurance for losses related to cyber-risks and attacks and information security and privacy liability, it may not be sufficient to offset the\nimpact of a material loss event.\nWe face substantial and increasingly intense competition for partner relationships, which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these\narrangements that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n In the ordinary course of our business we enter into different types of contractual arrangements with business partners in a variety of industries.\nFor example, we have partnered with Delta Air Lines, as well as many others globally, to offer cobranded cards for consumers and small businesses,\nand through our Membership Rewards program we have partnered with businesses in many industries, including the airline industry, to offer benefits\nto Card Member participants. Competition for relationships with key business partners is very intense and there can be no assurance we will be able\nto grow or maintain these partner relationships. Establishing and retaining attractive cobrand card partnerships is particularly competitive among\ncard issuers and networks as these partnerships typically have high-spending loyal customers. Our entire cobrand portfolio\n37\nTable of Contents\naccounted for approximately 22 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended December 31, 2015. Card Member loans held for\ninvestment related to our cobrand portfolio accounted for approximately 33 percent of our worldwide Card Member loans held for investment as of\nDecember 31, 2015, which do not include Card Member loans related to our cobrand partnerships with Costco Wholesale Corporation in the United\nStates and JetBlue Airways Corporation that were transferred to held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets effective December 1, 2015. See\nNote 2 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information on loans and receivables held for sale.\nWe face the risk that we could lose partner relationships, even after we have invested significant resources, time and expense in acquiring and\ndeveloping the relationships. The volume of billed business could decline and Card Member attrition could increase, in each case, significantly as a\nresult of the termination of one or more partnership relationships. In addition, some of our cobrand arrangements provide that, upon expiration or\ntermination, the cobrand partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the receivables generated with respect to its program, which\ncould result in a significant decline in our Card Member loans outstanding. For example, we previously announced that our U.S. cobrand relationship\nwith Costco is set to end in 2016 and we expect to sell the outstanding Card Member loans associated with the Costco portfolio. For a discussion on\nCostco and our expectations regarding the portfolio sale, see “Business Environment” under “MD&A.” In November 2015, Starwood Hotels &\nResorts Worldwide, with which we have a cobrand relationship, announced that it agreed to be acquired by Marriott International, which has a\ncobrand relationship with a competing card issuer.\nWe also face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us as competition for such relationships\nincreases. In 2015, both Card Member rewards expense and cost of Card Member services increased when compared to the prior year, reflecting a\nportion of the increased costs related to several recently renewed cobrand partnerships.\nThe loss of business partners (whether by non-renewal at the end of the contract period, such as the end of our relationship with Costco in the\nUnited States in 2016, or early termination as the result of a merger or otherwise, such as the withdrawal of American Airlines in 2014 from our\nAirport Club Access program for Centurion and Platinum Card Members) or the renegotiation of existing relationships with terms that are significantly\nworse for us could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. In addition, any publicity associated with the loss of\nany of our key business partners could harm our reputation, making it more difficult to attract and retain Card Members and merchants, and could\nlessen our negotiating power with our remaining and prospective business partners.\nWe have agreements with business partners in a variety of industries, including the airline industry, that represent a significant portion of\nour business. We are exposed to risks associated with these industries, including bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings,\nconsolidations and alliances of our partners, and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners.\nWe may be obligated to make or accelerate payments to certain business partners such as cobrand partners and merchants upon the\noccurrence of certain triggering events such as: (i) our filing for bankruptcy, (ii) our economic condition deteriorating such that our senior unsecured\ndebt rating is downgraded significantly below investment grade by S&P and Moody’s, (iii) our ceasing to have a public debt rating, or (iv) a shortfall in\ncertain performance levels. If we are not able to effectively manage these triggering events, we could unexpectedly have to make payments to these\npartners, which could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSimilarly, we have credit risk to certain cobrand partners relating to our prepayments for loyalty program points that may not be fully redeemed.\nWe are also exposed to risk from bankruptcies, liquidations, insolvencies, financial distress, restructurings, consolidations and other similar events\nthat may occur in any industry representing a significant portion of our billed business, which could negatively impact particular card products and\nservices (and billed business generally) and our financial condition and results of operations. For example, we could be materially impacted if we\nwere obligated to or elected to reimburse Card Members for products and services purchased from merchants that have ceased operations or\nstopped accepting our cards.\nThe airline industry, which represents a significant portion of our billed business, has undergone bankruptcies, restructurings, consolidations\nand other similar events in the past. The airline industry accounted for approximately eight percent of our worldwide billed business for the year\nended December 31, 2015. Our largest airline cobrand portfolio, American Express’ Delta SkyMiles, accounted for approximately six percent of our\nworldwide billed business for the year ended December 31, 2015 and approximately 20 percent of worldwide Card Member loans held for\ninvestment as of December 31, 2015. We have credit risk to the airline industry to the extent we protect Card Members against non-delivery of\ngoods and services, such as where we have remitted payment to an airline for a Card Member purchase of tickets that have not yet been used or\n“flown.” If we are unable to collect the amount from the airline, we will bear the loss for the amount credited to the Card Member.\nFor additional information relating to the general risks related to the airline industry, see “Risk Management — Institutional Credit Risk —\nExposure to the Airline Industry” under “MD&A.”\n38\nTable of Contents\nWe may not be successful in realizing the benefits associated with our strategic alliances, joint ventures and investment activity, and our\nbusiness and reputation could be negatively impacted.\nJoint ventures and minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially increasing\nthe financial, legal, operational and/or compliance risks associated with the joint venture or minority investment. In addition, we may be dependent\non joint venture partners, controlling shareholders or management who may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with\nours. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of the joint venture partner, controlling shareholders or management may adversely affect the\nvalue of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us and otherwise damage our reputation and brand.\nAs discussed in “Global Commercial Services,” we created a joint venture for our Global Business Travel operations in 2014. There can be no\nassurance that we will be able to realize the underlying assumptions related to the joint venture transaction, including accelerating the transformation\nand growth of the corporate travel business, creating additional investment capacity and enhancing its suite of products and services. We and the\nGBT JV face the risk of potential loss of key customers, vendors and other key business partners as a result of the joint venture transaction. Our\nfailure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with the joint venture transaction could cause us to fail to realize the\nanticipated benefits of the transaction, incur unanticipated liabilities and adversely affect our operations.\nWe rely on third-party providers of various computer systems, platforms and other services integral to the operations of our businesses.\nThese third parties may act in ways that could harm our business.\nWe rely on third-party service providers, merchants, processors, aggregators, GNS partners and other third parties for services that are\nintegral to our operations, including the timely transmission of accurate information across our global network. If a service provider or other third\nparty fails to provide the data quality, communications capacity or services we require, as a result of natural disaster, operational disruptions,\nterrorism, hacking or other cybersecurity incidents or any other reason, the failure could interrupt or compromise the quality of our services to\ncustomers.\nWe are subject to the risk that activities of our third-party service providers may adversely affect our business. A failure to exercise adequate\noversight over third-party service providers, including compliance with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements, could result in\nregulatory actions, fines, sanctions or economic and reputational harm to us. There is also a risk the confidentiality, integrity, privacy and/or security\nof data held by third parties or communicated over third-party networks or platforms could become compromised, which could significantly harm our\nbusiness even if the attack or breach does not impact our systems. In addition, the management of multiple third-party vendors increases our\noperational complexity and decreases our control. It is also possible that the cost efficiencies of certain outsourcings will decrease as the demand for\nthese services increases around the world.\nOur business is subject to the effects of geopolitical events, weather, natural disasters and other conditions.\nGeopolitical events, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, floods, health pandemics, intrusion into or degradation of\nour infrastructure by hackers and other catastrophic events can have a negative effect on our business. Because of our proximity to the World Trade\nCenter, our headquarters were damaged as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Similar events or other disasters or catastrophic\nevents in the future and events impacting other sectors of the economy, including the telecommunications and energy sectors, could have a negative\neffect on our businesses and infrastructure, including our information technology systems. Because we derive a portion of our revenues from travelrelated spending, our business will be sensitive to safety concerns, and thus is likely to decline during periods in which travelers become concerned\nabout safety issues or when travel might involve health-related risks. In addition, disruptions in air travel and other forms of travel caused by such\nevents can result in the payment of claims under travel interruption insurance policies that we offer and, if such disruptions to travel are prolonged,\nthey can materially adversely affect overall travel-related spending. If the conditions described above (or similar ones) result in widespread or lengthy\ndisruptions to travel, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Card Member spending may also be negatively impacted\nin areas affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events. The impact of such events on the overall economy may also adversely affect our\nfinancial condition or results of operations.\nOur success is dependent, in part, upon our executive officers and other key personnel, and the loss of key personnel could materially\nadversely affect our business.\nOur success depends, in part, on our executive officers and other key personnel. Our senior management team has significant industry\nexperience and would be difficult to replace. The market for qualified individuals is highly competitive, and we may not be able to attract and retain\nqualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel. As further described in\n“Supervision and Regulation — Compensation Practices,” our compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the Federal Reserve\nand the compensation practices of our U.S. bank subsidiaries are subject to review and oversight by the FDIC and the OCC. Regulatory review and\noversight could further affect our ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key personnel. The loss of key personnel could\nmaterially adversely affect our business.\n39\nTable of Contents\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks\nOngoing legal proceedings regarding provisions in our merchant contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, result in\nadditional litigation and/or arbitrations, subject us to substantial monetary damages and damage our reputation and brand.\nThe DOJ and certain states’ attorneys general brought an action against us alleging that the provisions in our card acceptance agreements\nwith merchants that prohibit merchants from discriminating against our card products at the point of sale violate the U.S. antitrust laws. Visa and\nMasterCard, which were also defendants in the DOJ and state action, entered into a settlement agreement and have been dismissed as parties\npursuant to that agreement, which was approved by the court. The settlement enjoins Visa and MasterCard from entering into contracts that prohibit\nmerchants from engaging in various actions to steer cardholders to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale. On February 19, 2015,\nthe trial court found that the challenged provisions in American Express card acceptance agreements were anticompetitive and on April 30, 2015\nissued a final judgment prohibiting us from enforcing certain elements of such provisions. We appealed this judgment and on December 18, 2015,\nthe Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit stayed the trial court’s judgment pending the issuance of its appellate decision. We are also a defendant\nin a number of actions and arbitration proceedings, including proposed class actions, filed by merchants that challenge the non-discrimination and\nhonor-all-cards provisions in our card acceptance agreements and seek damages. A description of these legal proceedings is contained in “Legal\nProceedings.”\nAn adverse outcome in these proceedings against us (including an adverse final judgment following appeal in the DOJ and state action) could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, require us to change our merchant agreements in a way that could expose\nour cards to increased merchant steering and other forms of discrimination that could impair the Card Member experience, result in additional\nlitigation and/or arbitrations, impose substantial monetary damages and damage our reputation and brand. Even if we were not required to change\nour merchant agreements, changes in Visa’s and MasterCard’s policies or practices as a result of legal proceedings, lawsuit settlements or\nregulatory actions could result in changes to our business practices and materially and adversely impact our profitability.\nOur business is subject to significant and extensive government regulation and supervision, which could adversely affect our results of\noperations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world. The current environment of additional\nregulation, enhanced supervision efforts and increased and unpredictable regulatory investigations and enforcement is likely to continue to result in\nchanges to our business practices, products and procedures, increased costs (including increased compliance costs), and potentially additional\npenalties and/or restitution payments to Card Members. In addition, new laws or regulations or changes in the enforcement of existing laws or\nregulations applicable to our businesses could impact the profitability of our business activities, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities or\nadopt new technologies, require us to change certain of our business practices or alter our relationships with partners, merchants and Card\nMembers, or affect retention of our key personnel. Such changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to\nmake any necessary changes and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to satisfy regulatory requirements to maintain our financial holding company status, our financial condition and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected, and we may be restricted in our ability to take certain capital actions (such as declaring dividends or repurchasing\noutstanding shares) or engage in certain activities or acquisitions. Additionally, our banking regulators have wide discretion in the examination and\nthe enforcement of applicable banking statutes and regulations and may restrict our ability to engage in certain activities or acquisitions or require us\nto maintain more capital.\nIn recent years, legislators and regulators have focused on the operation of card networks, including interchange fees paid to card issuers in\npayment networks such as Visa and MasterCard and the fees merchants are charged to accept cards. Fee regulation can significantly negatively\nimpact the discount revenue derived from our business, including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in\ncompetitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees. In some cases, such regulation extends to certain aspects of our business, for\nexample, GNS or cobrand arrangements or terms of card acceptance for merchants, including terms relating to non-discrimination and honor-allcards. We have brought a legal challenge and seek a ruling from the EU Court of Justice to invalidate the application of price caps in circumstances\nwhere three-party networks issue cards with a cobrand partner. There can be no assurance that our legal challenge will be successful. For a\ndescription of certain regulations and their impact on us, see “Global Network & Merchant Services — Regulation.” Legislators and regulators around\nthe world are aware of each other’s approaches to the regulation of the payments industry. Consequently, a development in one country, state or\nregion may influence regulatory approaches in another.\nWe are subject to certain provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the Patriot Act, with regard to maintaining effective AML\nprograms. Increased regulatory focus in this area could result in additional obligations or restrictions with respect to the types of products and\nservices we may offer to consumers, the countries in which our cards may be used, and the types of customers and merchants who can obtain or\naccept our cards. Activity such as money laundering or terrorist financing involving our cards could result in enforcement action, and our reputation\nmay\n40\nTable of Contents\nsuffer due to our customers’ association with certain countries, persons or entities or the existence of any such transactions. In addition, Member\nStates of the European Economic Area have implemented the PSD for electronic payment services that put in place a common legal framework for\nlicensing and supervision of payment services providers, including card issuers and merchant acquirers, and for their conduct of business.\nComplying with these and other regulations increases our costs and could reduce our revenue opportunities.\nVarious regulatory agencies and legislatures are also considering regulations and legislation covering identity theft, account management\nguidelines, credit bureau reporting, disclosure rules, security and marketing that would impact us directly, in part due to increased scrutiny of our\nunderwriting and account management standards. These new requirements may restrict our ability to issue charge and credit cards or partner with\nother financial institutions, which could adversely affect our revenue growth.\nSee “Supervision and Regulation” for more information about the material laws and regulations to which we are subject.\nLitigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments and/or requirements resulting in significantly\nincreased expenses, damage to our reputation and/or a material adverse effect on our business.\nBusinesses in the financial services and payments industries have historically been subject to significant legal actions, including class action\nlawsuits. Many of these actions have included claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages. While we have historically relied on our\narbitration clause in agreements with customers to limit our exposure to class action litigation, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be\nsuccessful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future. On October 7, 2015, the CFPB announced a proposal that would, among other changes,\nrequire that our consumer arbitration clause not apply to cases filed in court as class actions, unless and until class certification is denied or the class\nclaims are dismissed. This proposal is the beginning of a rulemaking process that may not result in a final rule, if any, becoming effective before\n2018. The continued focus of merchants on issues relating to the acceptance of various forms of payment may lead to additional litigation and other\nlegal actions. Given the inherent uncertainties involved in litigation, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some matters asserted\nagainst us, there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from litigation matters.\nWe have been subject to regulatory actions by the CFPB and other regulators and may continue to be involved in such actions, including\ngovernmental inquiries, investigations and enforcement proceedings, in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or\nregulations. Regulatory action could subject us to significant fines, penalties or other requirements resulting in increased expenses, limitations or\nconditions on our business activities, and damage to our reputation and our brand, which could adversely affect our results of operations and\nfinancial condition. The recent trend towards larger settlement amounts could lead to more adverse outcomes in any enforcement actions against us\nin the future. We expect that regulators will continue taking formal enforcement actions against financial institutions in addition to addressing\nsupervisory concerns through non-public supervisory actions or findings, which could involve restrictions on our activities, among other limitations\nthat could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity rules, and if we fail to meet these rules, our business would be adversely affected.\nFailure to meet current or future capital or liquidity requirements, including those imposed by the New Capital Rules, the LCR or by regulators\nin implementing other portions of the Basel III framework, could compromise our competitive position and could result in restrictions imposed by the\nFederal Reserve, including limiting our ability to pay common stock dividends, repurchase our common stock, invest in our business, expand our\nbusiness or engage in acquisitions.\nThere continues to be substantial uncertainty regarding significant portions of the capital and liquidity regime that will apply to us and our U.S.\nbank subsidiaries. As a result, the ultimate impact on our long-term capital and liquidity planning and our results of operations is not certain, although\nan increase in our capital and liquid asset levels could lower our return on equity.\nThe capital requirements applicable to the Company as a bank holding company and our U.S. bank subsidiaries have been substantially\nrevised to implement the international Basel III framework and are in the process of being phased-in. Once these revisions are fully phased-in, the\nCompany and our U.S. bank subsidiaries will be required to satisfy more stringent capital adequacy standards than in the past. As part of our\nrequired stress testing, both internally and by the Federal Reserve, we must continue to comply with applicable capital standards in the adverse and\nseverely adverse economic scenarios published by the Federal Reserve each year. To satisfy these requirements, it may be necessary for us to hold\nadditional capital in excess of that required by the New Capital Rules as they are phased-in.\n Compliance with capital adequacy and liquidity rules, including the New Capital Rules and the LCR, will require a material investment of\nresources. An inability to meet regulatory expectations regarding our compliance with applicable capital adequacy and liquidity rules may also\nnegatively impact the assessment of the Company and our U.S. bank subsidiaries by federal banking regulators.\nWe continue to progress through the parallel run phase of Basel III advanced approaches implementation. Depending on how the advanced\napproaches are ultimately implemented for our asset types, our capital ratios\n41\nTable of Contents\ncalculated under the advanced approaches may be lower than under the standardized approach. In such a case, we may need to hold significantly\nmore regulatory capital in order to maintain a given capital ratio.\nThere are several recent proposals or potential proposals that could significantly impact the regulatory capital standards and requirements\napplicable to financial institutions such as the Company and our U.S. bank subsidiaries, as well as our ability to meet these requirements. The Basel\nCommittee has adopted a framework that would impose a capital buffer on certain banks that may have an important impact on their domestic\neconomies (so-called “domestic systemically important banks,” or “D-SIBs”). Additionally, the Basel Committee has proposed a series of revisions to\nthe standardized approach for credit and operational risk capital requirements. If these or other proposals are adopted in the United States and\napplied to advanced approaches institutions, we could be required to hold significantly more capital.\nFor more information on capital adequacy requirements, see “Capital Adequacy” and “Liquidity Regulation” under “Supervision and\nRegulation.”\nWe are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our capital stock. Our subsidiaries are also subject to\nrestrictions that limit their ability to pay dividends to us, which may adversely affect our liquidity.\nWe are limited in our ability to pay dividends and repurchase capital stock by our regulators who have broad authority to prohibit any action\nthat would be considered an unsafe or unsound banking practice. For example, we are subject to a requirement to submit capital plans that include,\namong other things, projected dividend payments and repurchases of capital stock to the Federal Reserve for review. As part of the capital planning\nand stress testing process, our proposed capital actions are assessed against our ability to satisfy applicable capital requirements in the event of a\nstressed market environment. If our capital plan is not approved for any reason or if we fail to satisfy applicable capital requirements, our ability to\nundertake capital actions may be restricted. A failure to increase dividends along with our competitors, or any reduction of, or elimination of, our\ncommon stock dividend or share repurchase program would likely adversely affect the market price of our common stock and market perceptions of\nAmerican Express.\nOur ability to declare or pay dividends on, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of our common stock will be prohibited, subject to\ncertain exceptions, in the event that we do not declare and pay in full dividends for the last preceding dividend period of our Series B and Series C\npreferred stock.\nAmerican Express Company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for liquidity, and federal and state law limit the amount of dividends that\nour subsidiaries may pay to the parent company. In particular, our U.S. bank subsidiaries are subject to various statutory and regulatory limitations\non their declaration and payment of dividends. These limitations may hinder our ability to access funds we may need to make payments on our\nobligations, make dividend payments on outstanding American Express Company capital stock or otherwise achieve strategic objectives.\nFor more information on bank holding company and depository institution dividend restrictions, see “Dividends” under “Supervision and\nRegulation,” as well as “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity — Share Repurchases and Dividends” under “MD&A” and Note 23 to our\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nRegulation in the areas of privacy, data protection and information security could increase our costs and affect or limit our business\nopportunities and how we collect and/or use personal information.\nAs privacy, data protection and information security laws are interpreted and applied, compliance costs may increase, particularly in the\ncontext of ensuring that adequate data protection and data transfer mechanisms are in place. In recent years, there has been increasing regulatory\nenforcement and litigation activity in the areas of privacy, data protection and information security in the United States and in various countries in\nwhich we operate.\nIn addition, legislators and/or regulators in the United States and other countries in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising\nprivacy, data protection and information security laws that potentially could have significant impact on our current and planned privacy, data\nprotection and information security-related practices, our collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer and/or employee\ninformation, and some of our current or planned business activities. New legislation or regulation could increase our costs of compliance and\nbusiness operations and could reduce revenues from certain business initiatives. Moreover, the application of existing or new laws to existing\ntechnology and practices can be uncertain and may lead to additional compliance risk and cost.\nCompliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information security laws relating to customer and/or employee data could result\nin higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to fully maximize our closed-loop capability or provide certain products and\nservices, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws\ncould result in potentially significant regulatory and/or governmental investigations and/or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions, ongoing regulatory\nmonitoring, customer attrition, decreases in the use or acceptance of our cards and damage to our reputation and our brand.\n42\nTable of Contents\nWe may not be able to effectively manage the operational and compliance risks to which we are exposed.\nWe consider operational risk to be the risk of not achieving business objectives due to inadequate or failed processes or information systems,\npoor data quality, human error or the external environment (i.e., natural disasters). Operational risk includes, among others, the risk that employee\nerror or intentional misconduct could result in a material financial misstatement; a failure to monitor a third party’s compliance with a service level\nagreement or regulatory or legal requirements; or a failure to adequately monitor and control access to data in our systems we grant to third-party\nservice providers. As processes are changed, or new products and services are introduced, we may not fully appreciate or identify new operational\nrisks that may arise from such changes. Compliance risk arises from the failure to adhere to applicable laws, rules, regulations and internal policies\nand procedures. Operational and compliance risks can expose us to reputational risks as well as fines, civil money penalties or payment of damages\nand can lead to diminished business opportunities and diminished ability to expand key operations.\nIf we are not able to protect our intellectual property, our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected.\nWe rely on a variety of measures to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information, including copyrights, trademarks, patents and\ncontrols on access and distribution. These measures may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our\nintellectual property rights and a resulting loss of competitive advantage. In addition, competitors or other third parties may allege that our systems,\nprocesses or technologies infringe on their intellectual property rights. Given the complex, rapidly changing and competitive technological and\nbusiness environment in which we operate, and the potential risks and uncertainties of intellectual property-related litigation, a future assertion of an\ninfringement claim against us could cause us to lose significant revenues, incur significant license, royalty or technology development expenses, or\npay significant monetary damages.\nTax legislative initiatives or assessments by governmental authorities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. The laws and regulations related to tax\nmatters are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although management believes our positions are reasonable, we are subject\nto audit by the Internal Revenue Service and by tax authorities in all the jurisdictions in which we conduct business operations. These tax authorities\nmay challenge our positions or apply existing laws and regulations more broadly, which may potentially result in a significant increase in liabilities for\ntaxes and interest in excess of accrued liabilities.\nNew tax legislative initiatives may be proposed from time to time, such as proposals for comprehensive tax reform in the United States, which\nmay impact our effective tax rate and could adversely affect our tax positions or tax liabilities. In addition, unilateral or multi-jurisdictional actions by\nvarious tax authorities, including an increase in tax audit activity, to address “base erosion and profit shifting” by multinational companies could also\nhave an adverse impact on our tax liabilities.\nCredit, Liquidity and Market Risks\nOur risk management policies and procedures may not be effective.\nOur risk management framework seeks to identify and mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return. We have established policies\nand procedures intended to identify, monitor and manage the types of risk to which we are subject, including credit risk, market risk, asset liability\nrisk, liquidity risk, operational risk, compliance risk, model risk and reputational risk. See “Risk Management” under “MD&A” for a discussion of the\npolicies and procedures we use to identify, monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our businesses. Although we have devoted\nsignificant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future, these policies and\nprocedures, as well as our risk management techniques such as our hedging strategies, may not be fully effective. There may also be risks that\nexist, or that develop in the future, that we have not appropriately anticipated, identified or mitigated. As regulations and markets in which we operate\ncontinue to evolve, our risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes. If our risk management framework\ndoes not effectively identify or mitigate our risks, we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.\nManagement of our risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical and/or forecasting models. Although we have a governance\nframework for model development and independent model validation, the modeling methodology could be erroneous or the models could be\nmisused. If our decisions are based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports, we may face adverse consequences, such as financial loss,\npoor business and strategic decision-making, or damage to our reputation. In addition, some decisions our regulators make, including those related\nto our capital distribution plans, may be adversely impacted if they perceive the quality of our models to be insufficient.\n43\nTable of Contents\nWe may not be able to effectively manage credit risk related to consumer debt, business loans, settlement with GNS partners, merchant\nand consumer bankruptcies, delinquencies and other credit trends that can affect spending on card products, debt payments by\nindividual and corporate customers and businesses that accept our card products, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to both individual credit risk, principally from consumer and small business Card Member receivables and loans, and\ninstitutional credit risk from merchants, GNS partners, GCS clients, Plenti partners and treasury and investment counterparties. Third parties may\ndefault on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. Country, regional and political risks can\ncontribute to credit risk. Our ability to assess creditworthiness may be impaired if the criteria or models we use to manage our credit risk become\nless predictive of future losses, which could cause our losses to rise and have a negative impact on our results of operations. Rising delinquencies\nand rising rates of bankruptcy are often precursors of future write-offs and may require us to increase our reserve for loan losses. After write-off and\ndelinquency rates reached historical lows, they have recently leveled out and begun to increase in line with our expectations. Higher write-off rates\nand an increase in our reserve for loan losses adversely affect our profitability and the performance of our securitizations, and may increase our cost\nof funds. In addition, our ability to recover amounts that we have previously written off may be limited, which could have a negative impact on our\nrevenues.\nAlthough we make estimates to provide for credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of loans and receivables, these estimates may not be\naccurate. In addition, the information we use in managing our credit risk may be inaccurate or incomplete. Although we regularly review our credit\nexposure to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries, countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns, default\nrisk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to foresee or detect, such as fraud. We may also fail to receive full information with\nrespect to the credit risks of our customers. In addition, our ability to manage credit risk may be adversely affected by legal or regulatory changes\n(such as bankruptcy laws and minimum payment regulations). Increased credit risk, whether resulting from underestimating the credit losses\ninherent in our portfolio of loans and receivables, deteriorating economic conditions, changes in our mix of business or otherwise, could require us to\nincrease our provision for losses and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAdverse financial market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital.\nWe need liquidity to pay merchants, operating and other expenses, interest on debt and dividends on capital stock and to repay maturing\nliabilities. If we are unsuccessful in managing our liquidity risk, we may maintain too much liquidity, which can be costly and limit financial flexibility;\nor we may be too illiquid, which could limit our investments in growth opportunities, curtail operations or result in financial distress during a liquidity\nevent.\nThe principal sources of our liquidity are payments from Card Members and merchants, cash flow from our investment portfolio and assets,\nconsisting mainly of cash or assets that are readily convertible into cash, direct and third-party sourced deposits, debt instruments such as\nunsecured medium- and long-term notes and asset securitizations, securitized borrowings through our secured financing facilities, the Federal\nReserve discount window and long-term committed bank borrowing facilities.\nOur ability to obtain financing in the debt capital markets for unsecured term debt and asset securitizations is dependent on investor demand.\nDisruptions, uncertainty or volatility across the financial markets could negatively impact market liquidity and limit our access to capital required to\noperate our business. Such market conditions may limit our ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities, satisfy regulatory capital\nrequirements and access the capital necessary to grow our business. As such, we may be forced to delay raising capital or bear an unattractive cost\nto raise capital, which could decrease profitability and significantly reduce financial flexibility. Market disruption and volatility could have an adverse\neffect, which may be material, on our ability to access capital and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor a further discussion of our liquidity and funding needs, see “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity — Funding Programs and\nActivities” under “MD&A.”\nAny reduction in our and our subsidiaries’ credit ratings could increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the\ncapital markets and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRating agencies regularly evaluate us and our subsidiaries, and their ratings of our and our subsidiaries’ long-term and short-term debt are\nbased on a number of factors, including financial strength as well as factors not within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services\nindustry generally, and the wider state of the economy. Our and our subsidiaries’ ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by\nany of the rating agencies, which could, among other things, adversely limit our access to the capital markets and adversely affect the cost and other\nterms upon which we and our subsidiaries are able to obtain funding.\n44\nTable of Contents\nAdverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease earnings we receive from our international operations and\nimpact our capital.\nDuring 2015, approximately 24 percent of our total revenues net of interest expense were generated from activities outside the United States.\nWe are exposed to foreign exchange risk from our international operations, and accordingly the revenue we generate outside the United States is\nsubject to unpredictable fluctuations if the values of other currencies change relative to the U.S. dollar, which could have a material adverse effect on\nour results of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2015, foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted our net\nrevenues of $32.8 billion by approximately $1.3 billion as the U.S. dollar strengthened against many currencies over the course of the year.\nWe may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of other currencies into U.S. dollars.\nPolitical and economic conditions in other countries could also impact the availability of foreign exchange for the payment by the local card issuer of\nobligations arising out of local Card Members’ spending outside such country and for the payment of card bills by Card Members who are billed in a\ncurrency other than their local currency. Substantial and sudden devaluation of local Card Members’ currency can also affect their ability to make\npayments to the local issuer of the card in connection with spending outside the local country. The occurrence of any of these circumstances could\nfurther impact our result of operations.\nInterest rate increases could materially adversely affect our earnings.\nInterest rates have remained at historically low levels for a prolonged period of time and we expect interest rates to rise in the future. If the rate\nof interest we pay on our borrowings increases more than the rate of interest we earn on our loans, our net interest yield, and consequently our net\nincome, could fall. Our interest expense was approximately $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. A hypothetical 1.0 percent increase\nin interest rates would have resulted in a decrease to our annual net interest income of approximately $216 million as of December 31, 2015. In\naddition, interest rate changes may affect customer behavior, such as impacting the loan balance amounts Card Members carry on their credit cards\nor their ability to make payments as higher interest rates lead to higher payment requirements, further impacting our results of operations.\nFor a further discussion of our interest rate risk, see “Risk Management — Market Risk Management Process” under “MD&A.”\nThe value of our assets or liabilities may be adversely impacted by economic, political or market conditions.\nMarket risk represents the loss in value of portfolios and financial instruments due to adverse changes in market variables, which could\nnegatively impact our financial condition. We held approximately $3.8 billion of investment securities as of December 31, 2015. In the event that\nactual default rates of these investment securities were to significantly change from historical patterns due to challenges in the economy or\notherwise, it could have a material adverse impact on the value of our investment portfolio. Defaults or economic disruptions, even in countries or\nterritories in which we do not have material investment exposure, conduct business or have operations, could adversely affect us.\nAn inability to accept or maintain deposits due to market demand or regulatory constraints could materially adversely affect our liquidity\nposition and our ability to fund our business.\nAs a source of funding, our U.S. bank subsidiaries accept deposits from individuals through third-party brokerage networks as well as directly\nfrom consumers through American Express Personal Savings. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $54.1 billion in total U.S. retail\ndeposits. We face strong competition in the deposit markets, particularly as to brokerage networks. Aggressive pricing throughout the industry may\nadversely affect our retention of existing balances and the cost-efficient acquisition of new deposit funds. If we are required to offer higher interest\nrates to attract or maintain deposits, our funding costs will be adversely impacted. Customers could also close their accounts or reduce balances in\nfavor of products and services offered by competitors for reasons other than price, including general dissatisfaction with our products or services and\nconcerns over online security or our reputation.\nOur ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates on deposits is also dependent on capital levels of our U.S. bank\nsubsidiaries. The FDIA in certain circumstances prohibits banks, including Centurion Bank and American Express Bank, from accepting brokered\ndeposits and applies other restrictions, such as a cap on interest rates we may pay. See “Prompt Corrective Action” under “Regulation and\nSupervision” for additional information. A significant amount of our outstanding U.S. retail deposits has been raised through third-party brokerage\nnetworks, and such deposits are considered brokered deposits for bank regulatory purposes.\nWhile Centurion Bank and American Express Bank were considered “well capitalized” as of December 31, 2015 and had no restrictions regarding\nacceptance of brokered deposits or setting of interest rates, there can be no assurance they will continue to meet this definition. The New Capital\nRules, when fully phased in, will require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital, with a greater\nemphasis on common\n45\nTable of Contents\nequity. Additionally, our regulators can adjust the requirements to be “well capitalized” at any time and have authority to place limitations on our\ndeposit businesses, including the interest rate we pay on deposits. An inability to attract or maintain deposits in the future could materially adversely\naffect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business.",

      "item1a":"This section highlights specific risks that could affect us and our businesses. You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other\ninformation set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on the information currently known to us, we believe the following information identifies the most\nsignificant risk factors affecting us. However, the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not\npresently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.\nIf any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events or if the circumstances described in the risks and uncertainties occur or continue to\noccur, these events or circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. These events could also\nhave a negative effect on the trading price of our securities.\nStrategic, Business and Competitive Risks\nDifficult conditions in the business and economic environment, as well as political conditions in the United States and elsewhere, may materially\nadversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur results of operations are materially affected by economic, market, political and social conditions in the United States and abroad. Uneven global economic\ngrowth has had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on us, in part because we are very dependent upon the level of consumer and business activity\nand the demand for payment and financing products. A prolonged period of slow economic growth or deterioration in economic conditions could change\ncustomer behaviors, including spending on our cards and the ability and willingness of Card Members to pay amounts owed to us. Travel and entertainment\nexpenditures, which comprised approximately 25 percent of our U.S. billed business during 2016, for example, are sensitive to business and personal\ndiscretionary spending levels and also tend to decline during general economic downturns.\nGeopolitical trends toward nationalism and protectionism and the weakening or dissolution of international trade pacts may increase the cost of, or otherwise\ninterfere with, conducting business. Further, economic or political instability in certain regions or countries could negatively affect consumer and business\nspending, including in other parts of the world.\nFactors such as consumer spending, business investment, government spending, interest rates, tax rates, fuel and other energy costs, the volatility and strength\nof the capital markets, inflation and deflation all affect the economic environment and, ultimately, our profitability. An economic downturn characterized by higher\nunemployment, lower family income, lower consumer spending, lower demand for credit, lower corporate earnings or lower business investment is likely to\nmaterially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, such factors may cause our earnings, credit metrics and\nmargins to fluctuate and diverge from expectations of analysts and investors, who may have differing assumptions regarding their impact on our business,\nadversely affecting, and/or increasing the volatility of, the trading price of our common shares.\n17\nTable of Contents\nOur operating results may suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payments industry.\nThe payments industry is highly competitive, and we compete with charge, credit and debit card networks, issuers and acquirers, paper-based transactions (e.g.,\ncash and checks), bank transfer models (e.g., wire transfers and ACH), as well as evolving and growing alternative payment and financing providers.\nWe believe Visa and MasterCard are larger than we are in most countries. As a result, card issuers and acquirers on the Visa and MasterCard networks may be\nable to benefit from the dominant position, scale, resources, marketing and pricing of those networks.\nSome of our competitors have developed, or may develop, substantially greater financial and other resources than we have, including larger cash reserves, may\noffer richer value propositions or a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective advertising, marketing or cross-selling\nstrategies to acquire and retain more customers, capture a greater share of spending and borrowings, attain and develop more attractive cobrand card programs\nand maintain greater merchant acceptance than we have. We may not be able to compete effectively against these threats or respond or adapt to changes in\nconsumer spending habits as effectively as our competitors. We expect expenses such as Card Member rewards and Card Member services expenses to\ncontinue to increase as we improve our value propositions for Card Members, including in response to increased competition.\nSpending on our cards could continue to be impacted by increasing consumer usage of charge, credit and debit cards issued on other networks, as well as\nadoption of payment systems based on ACH or other payment mechanisms. To the extent other payment mechanisms, systems and products continue to\nsuccessfully expand, our discount revenues and our ability to access transaction data through our closed-loop network could be negatively impacted. If we are\nnot able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors, drive value for our customers and/or effectively grow in areas such as mobile and online payments and\nemerging technologies, we may not be able to compete effectively against these threats.\nTo the extent we expand into new business areas and new geographic regions, we may face competitors with more experience and more established\nrelationships with relevant customers, regulators and industry participants, which could adversely affect our ability to compete. We may face additional\ncompliance and regulatory risk to the extent that we expand into new business areas and we may need to dedicate more expense, time and resources to comply\nwith regulatory requirements than our competitors, particularly those that are not regulated financial institutions. In addition, companies that control access to\nconsumer and merchant payment method choices through digital wallets, mobile applications or at the point of sale could choose not to accept or could suppress\nuse of our products or could restrict our access to our customers and transaction data. Such companies could also require payments from us to participate in\nsuch digital wallets and applications, impacting our profitability on transactions. Laws and business practices that favor local competitors, require card\ntransactions to be routed over domestic networks or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain businesses could slow our growth in international regions.\nFurther, expanding our service offerings, adding customer acquisition channels and forming new partnerships could have higher cost structures than our current\narrangements, and could adversely impact our average discount rate or dilute our brand.\nMany of our competitors are subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes. More restrictive laws and regulations that\ndo not apply to all of our competitors can put us at a competitive disadvantage, including prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions, regulating our\ncontract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance or adversely affecting our cost structure. See “ Ongoing legal proceedings regarding\nprovisions in our merchant contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, result in additional litigation and/or arbitrations, subject us to\nsubstantial monetary damages and damage our reputation and brand ” for a discussion of the potential impact on our ability to compete effectively if ongoing\nlegal proceedings limit our ability to prevent merchants from engaging in various actions to discriminate against our card products.\nWe face substantial and increasingly intense competition for partner relationships, which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these\narrangements that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nIn the ordinary course of our business we enter into different types of contractual arrangements with business partners in a variety of industries. For example, we\nhave partnered with Delta Air Lines, as well as many others globally, to offer cobranded cards for consumers and small businesses, and through our\nMembership Rewards program we have partnered with businesses in many industries, including the airline industry, to offer benefits to Card Member\nparticipants. Competition for relationships with key business partners is very intense and there can be no assurance we will be able to grow or maintain these\npartner relationships. Establishing and retaining attractive cobrand card partnerships is particularly competitive among card issuers and networks as these\npartnerships typically have high-spending loyal customers. Our entire cobrand portfolio accounted for approximately 18 percent of our worldwide billed business\nfor the year ended December 31, 2016. Card Member loans related to our cobrand portfolio accounted for approximately 34 percent of our worldwide Card\nMember loans as of December 31, 2016.\n18\nTable of Contents\nCobrand arrangements are entered into for a fixed period, generally ranging from five to eight years, and will terminate in accordance with their terms, including\nat the end of the fixed period unless extended or renewed at the option of the parties, or upon early termination as a result of an event of default or otherwise.\nWe face the risk that we could lose partner relationships, even after we have invested significant resources, time and expense in acquiring and developing the\nrelationships. The volume of billed business could decline and Card Member attrition could increase, in each case, significantly as a result of the termination of\none or more cobrand partnership relationships. In addition, some of our cobrand arrangements provide that, upon expiration or termination, the cobrand partner\nmay purchase or designate a third party to purchase the loans generated with respect to its program, which could result in a significant decline in our Card\nMember loans outstanding. For example, our U.S. cobrand relationship with Costco ended in 2016, and we sold the outstanding Card Member loans associated\nwith the Costco portfolio. In 2016, Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, with which we have a cobrand partnership, was acquired by Marriott International,\nwhich has a cobrand partnership with a competing card issuer.\nWe also face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us as competition for such relationships continues to increase.\nWe make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards\nearned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. The amount we pay to our cobrand partners has\nincreased, particularly in the United States, and may continue to increase as arrangements are renegotiated due to increasingly intense competition for cobrand\npartners among card issuers and networks. We may also choose to not continue certain cobrand relationships.\nThe loss of business partners (whether by non-renewal at the end of the contract period, such as the end of our relationship with Costco in the United States in\n2016, or early termination as the result of a merger or otherwise, such as the withdrawal of American Airlines in 2014 from our Airport Club Access program for\nCenturion ® and Platinum Card ® Members) or the renegotiation of existing partnerships with terms that are significantly worse for us could have a material\nadverse impact on our business and results of operations. In addition, any publicity associated with the loss of any of our key business partners could harm our\nreputation, making it more difficult to attract and retain Card Members and merchants, and could weaken our negotiating position with our remaining and\nprospective business partners.\nWe face continued intense competitive pressure that may impact the prices we charge merchants that accept our cards for payment for goods and\nservices.\nUnlike our competitors in the payments industry that rely on revolving credit balances to drive profits, our business model is focused on Card Member spending.\nDiscount revenue, which represents fees generally charged to merchants when Card Members use their cards to purchase goods and services on our network,\nis primarily driven by billed business volumes and is our largest single revenue source. In recent years, we experienced some reduction in our global weighted\naverage merchant discount rate and have been under increasing pressure, including as a result of regulatory-mandated reductions to competitors’ pricing, to\nreduce merchant discount rates and undertake other repricing initiatives. We also face pressure from competitors that have other sources of income or lower\nexpense bases that can make their pricing more attractive to key business partners and merchants. Merchants are also able to negotiate incentives and pricing\nconcessions from us as a condition to accepting our cards. As merchants consolidate and become even larger, we may have to increase the amount of\nincentives and/or concessions we provide to certain merchants, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Competitive and regulatory\npressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the costs of these incentives. We further expect some erosion of our average merchant discount rate as we\nseek to increase merchant acceptance. We may not be successful in significantly expanding merchant acceptance or offsetting rate erosion with volumes at new\nmerchants.\nIn addition, differentiated payment models and technologies from non-traditional players in the alternative payments space and the regulatory and litigation\nenvironment could pose challenges to our traditional payment model and adversely impact our average discount rate. Some merchants also continue to invest in\ntheir own payment solutions, such as proprietary-branded mobile wallets, using both traditional and new technology platforms. If merchants are able to drive\nbroad consumer adoption and usage, it could adversely impact our merchant discount rate and billed business volumes.\nA continuing priority of ours is to drive greater and differentiated value to our merchants which, if not successful, could negatively impact our discount revenue\nand financial results. If the average merchant discount rate declines more than expected, we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing\nbilled business volumes, increasing other sources of revenue, such as fee-based revenue or interest income, or both. We may not succeed in maintaining\nmerchant discount rates or offsetting the impact of declining merchant discount rates, particularly in the current regulatory environment, which could materially\nand adversely affect our revenues and profitability, and therefore our ability to invest in innovation and in value-added services for merchants and Card\nMembers.\n19\nTable of Contents\nSurcharging or steering by merchants could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn certain countries, such as Australia and certain Member States in the EU, merchants are expressly permitted by law to surcharge card purchases. The\nnumber of countries in the EU that permit surcharging and the potential for selective surcharging of American Express cards could increase following adoption of new EU-wide regulation, as discussed in “Supervision and Regulation — Payments Regulation.” In Australia, we have seen merchant surcharging on American\nExpress cards in certain merchant categories, and in some cases, the surcharge is greater than that applied to Visa and MasterCard cards, a practice that is\nknown as differential surcharging.\nWe also encounter merchants that accept our cards, but tell their customers that they prefer to accept another type of payment or otherwise seek to suppress\nuse of our cards. Our Card Members value the ability to use their cards where and when they want to, and we, therefore, take steps to meet our Card Members’\nexpectations and to protect the American Express brand by prohibiting this form of discrimination, subject to local legal requirements.\nIf surcharging, steering or other forms of discrimination become widespread, American Express cards and credit and charge cards generally could become less\ndesirable to consumers, which could result in a decrease in cards-in-force and transaction volumes. The impact could vary depending on such factors as the\nmanner in which a surcharge is levied, how Card Members are steered to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale and whether and to what\nextent these actions are applied to other payment cards, including whether it varies depending on the type of card, network, acquirer or issuer. Discrimination\nagainst American Express cards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly to the extent it\ndisproportionately impacts our Card Members.\nIf we are not able to invest successfully in, and compete at the leading edge of, technological developments across all our businesses, our revenue\nand profitability could be negatively affected.\nOur industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes. In order to compete in our industry, we need to continue to invest across all areas of our\nbusiness, including in transaction processing, data management and analytics, customer interactions and communications, alternative payment mechanisms and\nrisk management and compliance systems. Incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures and take\nconsiderable time, and ultimately may not be successful. We expect that new technologies in the payments industry will continue to emerge, and these new\ntechnologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our products and services.\nThe process of developing new products and services, enhancing existing products and services and adapting to technological changes and evolving industry\nstandards is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could\nsignificantly impede our ability to compete effectively. Consumer and merchant adoption is a key competitive factor and our competitors may develop products,\nplatforms or technologies that become more widely adopted than ours. In addition, we may underestimate the time and expense we must invest in new products\nand services before they generate material revenues, if at all.\nOur ability to develop, acquire or access competitive technologies or business processes on acceptable terms may also be limited by intellectual property rights\nthat third parties, including competitors and potential competitors, may assert. In addition, our ability to adopt new technologies may be inhibited by a need for\nindustry-wide standards, a changing legislative and regulatory environment, the need for internal product and engineering expertise, resistance to change from\nCard Members or merchants, or the complexity of our systems.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to promote card usage through marketing and promotion, merchant acceptance and Card Member rewards\nand services, or to effectively control the costs of such investments, both of which may impact our profitability.\nRevenue growth is dependent on increasing consumer and business spending on our cards and growing card lending balances. We have been spending at\nelevated levels on a number of growth initiatives over the past several years, including to attract new Card Members, reduce Card Member attrition and capture\na greater share of customers’ total spending and borrowings. There can be no assurance that our investments to acquire Card Members and increase usage of\nour cards will be effective. For example, we may not be successful in developing and issuing new and enhanced cards or customers may not accept our new\nproducts and services, which would negatively impact our results of operations. Increasing spending on our cards also depends on our continued expansion of\nmerchant acceptance of our cards. If the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows or reverses itself, our business could suffer.\nAnother way we invest in customer value is through our Membership Rewards program, as well as other Card Member benefits. Any significant change in, or\nfailure by management to reasonably estimate, actual redemptions of Membership Rewards points and associated redemption costs could adversely affect our\nprofitability. In addition, many credit card issuers have instituted rewards and cobrand programs and may introduce programs and services that are similar to or\nmore attractive than ours.\n20\nTable of Contents\nWe may not be able to cost-effectively manage and expand Card Member benefits, including containing the growth of marketing, promotion, rewards and Card\nMember services expenses in the future. If such expenses continue to increase beyond our expectations, we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact\nby increasing payments volume, increasing other areas of revenues such as fee-based revenues, or both. We may not succeed in doing so, particularly in the\ncurrent regulatory environment.\nOur brand and reputation are key assets of our Company, and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace.\nOur brand and its attributes are key assets of ours, and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve, grow and leverage the value of our\nbrand. Our ability to attract and retain consumer and small business Card Members and corporate clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of\nour level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, merchant acceptance, financial condition and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or\npublicity regarding these matters — even if related to seemingly isolated incidents and whether or not factually correct — could erode trust and confidence and\ndamage our reputation among existing and potential Card Members and corporate clients, which could make it difficult for us to attract new Card Members and\ncustomers and maintain existing ones. Negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances, including\ncard practices, regulatory compliance and the use and protection of customer information, and from actions taken by regulators or others in response to such\nconduct. Social media channels can also cause rapid, widespread reputational harm to our brand.\nOur brand and reputation may also be harmed by actions taken by third parties that are outside our control. For example, any shortcoming of a third-party\nvendor, merchant acquirer or GNS partner may be attributed by Card Members and merchants to us, thus damaging our reputation and brand value. The lack of\nacceptance or suppression of card usage by merchants can also negatively impact perceptions of our brand and our products, lower overall transaction volume\nand increase the attractiveness of other payment products or systems. Adverse developments with respect to our industry may also, by association, negatively\nimpact our reputation, or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us. Furthermore, as a corporation with headquarters and\noperations located in the United States, a negative perception of the United States arising from its political or other positions could harm the perception of our\ncompany and our brand. Although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand, negative perceptions or publicity could\nmaterially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nA significant operating disruption, a major information security incident or an increase in fraudulent activity using our cards could lead to\nreputational damage to our brand and significant legal, regulatory and financial exposure, and could reduce the use and acceptance of our charge\nand credit cards.\nWe and other third parties process, transmit and store account information in connection with our charge and credit cards and prepaid products, and in the\nnormal course of our business, we collect, analyze and retain significant volumes of certain types of personally identifiable and other information pertaining to our\ncustomers and employees.\nGlobal financial institutions like us have experienced a significant increase in information security risk in recent years and will likely continue to be the target of\nincreasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, including computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, social engineering attacks (including phishing and\nimpersonation), denial of service and security attacks. For example, we and other U.S. financial services providers have been the targets of distributed\ndenial-of-service attacks from sophisticated third parties.\nOur networks and systems are subject to constant attempts to identify and exploit potential vulnerabilities in our operating environment with intent to disrupt our\nbusiness operations and capture, destroy or manipulate various types of information relating to corporate trade secrets, customer information, including Card\nMember and loyalty program account information, employee information and other sensitive business information, including acquisition activity, financial results\nand intellectual property. There are a number of motivations for cyber threat actors, including criminal activities such as fraud, identity theft and ransom,\ncorporate or nation-state espionage, political agendas, public embarrassment with the intent to cause financial or reputational harm, intent to disrupt information\ntechnology systems, and to expose and exploit potential security and privacy vulnerabilities in corporate systems and websites.\nAs outsourcing, specialization of functions and technology innovation within the payments industry increase, more third parties are involved in processing\ntransactions using our cards and there is a risk the confidentiality, integrity, privacy and/or security of data held by third parties or to which they have access,\nincluding merchants that accept our cards and our business partners, may be compromised, which could lead to unauthorized transactions on our cards and\ncosts associated with responding to such an incident.\n21\nTable of Contents\nWe develop and maintain systems and processes aimed at detecting and preventing information security incidents and fraudulent activity, which require\nsignificant investment, maintenance and ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and regulatory requirements change and as efforts to overcome\nsecurity measures become more sophisticated. Despite our efforts, the possibility of information security incidents, malicious social engineering, fraudulent or\nother malicious activities and human error or malfeasance cannot be eliminated entirely. Risks associated with each of these remain, including the unauthorized\ndisclosure, release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, modification, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information (including account data\ninformation) or negative impact to online accounts and systems. These risks will likely evolve as new technology is deployed. For example, with the increased\nuse of EMV technology, we may see a decrease in traditional fraud risk, but sophisticated fraudsters may develop new ways to commit fraud and we may see an\nincrease in online fraud and impersonation and identity takeover attempts.\nOur information technology systems, including our transaction authorization, clearing and settlement systems, and data centers may experience service\ndisruptions or degradation because of technology malfunction, sudden increases in customer transaction volume, natural disasters, accidents, power outages,\ninternet outages, telecommunications failures, fraud, denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, terrorism, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or similar events. Service disruptions could prevent access to our online services and account information, compromise Company or customer data, and impede\ntransaction processing and financial reporting. Inadequate infrastructure in lesser-developed countries could also result in service disruptions, which could\nimpact our ability to do business in those countries.\nIf our information technology systems experience a significant disruption or breach, or if actual or perceived fraud levels or other illegal activities involving our\ncards or customer online accounts were to rise due to an information security incident at a business partner, merchant or other market participant, employee\nerror, malfeasance or otherwise, it could lead to the loss of data or data integrity, regulatory investigations and intervention (such as mandatory card reissuance),\nincreased litigation (including class action litigation), remediation and response costs, greater concerns of customers and/or business partners relating to the\nprivacy and security of their data, and reputational and financial damage to our brand, which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards, and have a\nmaterial adverse impact on our business.\nIf such disruptions or breaches are not detected quickly, their effect could be compounded. Information security incidents and other actual or perceived failures\nto maintain confidentiality, integrity, privacy and/or data protection, including leaked business data, may also disrupt our operations, undermine our competitive\nadvantage through the disclosure of sensitive company information, divert management attention and resources, and negatively impact the assessment of us\nand our subsidiaries by banking regulators and rating agencies.\nSuccessful cyberattacks or data breaches at other large financial institutions, large retailers or other market participants, whether or not we are impacted, could\nlead to a general loss of customer confidence that could negatively affect us, including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security\nmeasures or harming the reputation of the financial system in general, which could result in reduced use of our products and services. Although we have\ninsurance for losses related to cyber risks and attacks and information security and privacy liability, it may not be sufficient to offset the impact of a material loss\nevent.\nWe have agreements with business partners in a variety of industries, including the airline industry, that represent a significant portion of our\nbusiness. We are exposed to risks associated with these industries, including bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings, consolidations and\nalliances of our partners, and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners.\nWe may be obligated to make or accelerate payments to certain business partners such as cobrand partners and merchants upon the occurrence of certain\ntriggering events such as: (i) our economic condition deteriorating such that our senior unsecured debt rating is downgraded significantly below investment grade\nby S&P and Moody’s, (ii) our ceasing to have a public debt rating, or (iii) a shortfall in certain performance levels. If we are not able to effectively manage these\ntriggering events, we could unexpectedly have to make payments to these partners, which could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of\noperations.\nWe are also exposed to risk from bankruptcies, liquidations, insolvencies, financial distress, restructurings, consolidations and other similar events that may\noccur in any industry representing a significant portion of our billed business, which could negatively impact particular card products and services (and billed\nbusiness generally) and our financial condition and results of operations. For example, we could be materially impacted if we were obligated to or elected to\nreimburse Card Members for products and services purchased from merchants that have ceased operations or stopped accepting our cards.\nThe airline industry, which represents a significant portion of our billed business, has undergone bankruptcies, restructurings, consolidations and other similar\nevents in the past. The airline industry accounted for approximately 8 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our\nlargest airline cobrand portfolio, American Express’ Delta SkyMiles, accounted for approximately 7 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016 and approximately 20 percent of worldwide Card Member loans as of December 31, 2016. We have credit risk to the airline industry to the\nextent we protect Card Members against non-delivery of goods and services, such as where we have remitted payment to an airline for a Card Member\npurchase of tickets that have not yet been used or “flown.” If we are unable to collect the amount from the airline, we may bear the loss for the amount credited\nto the Card Member.\n22\nTable of Contents\nFor additional information relating to the general risks related to the airline industry, see “Risk Management — Institutional Credit Risk — Exposure to the Airline\nIndustry” under “MD&A.”\nWe may not be successful in realizing the benefits associated with our acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and investment activity, and\nour business and reputation could be negatively impacted.\nWe have acquired a number of businesses and have made a number of strategic investments, and continue to evaluate potential transactions. These\ntransactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify and secure\nfuture acquisition candidates on terms and conditions that are acceptable to us, or complete proposed acquisitions and investments, which could impair our\ngrowth. Our failure to successfully integrate acquired companies, businesses or technologies into our existing operations could cause us to fail to realize the\nanticipated benefits of the acquisition or investment, incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally.\nJoint ventures, including our GBT JV, and minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially\nincreasing the financial, legal, operational and/or compliance risks associated with the joint venture or minority investment. In addition, we may be dependent on\njoint venture partners, controlling shareholders or management who may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours. Business\ndecisions or other actions or omissions of the joint venture partner, controlling shareholders or management may adversely affect the value of our investment,\nresult in litigation or regulatory action against us and otherwise damage our reputation and brand.\nWe rely on third-party providers of various computer systems, platforms and other services integral to the operations of our businesses. These third\nparties may act in ways that could harm our business.\nWe rely on third-party service providers, merchants, processors, aggregators, GNS partners and other third parties for services that are integral to our\noperations, including the timely transmission of accurate information across our global network. If a service provider or other third party fails to provide the data\nquality, communications capacity or services we require, as a result of natural disaster, operational disruptions, terrorism, hacking or other cybersecurity\nincidents, or any other reason, the failure could interrupt or compromise the quality of our services to customers.\nWe are subject to the risk that activities of our third-party service providers may adversely affect our business. A failure to exercise adequate oversight over thirdparty service providers, including compliance with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements, could result in regulatory actions, fines,\nsanctions or economic and reputational harm to us. There is also a risk the confidentiality, integrity, privacy and/or security of data held by third parties or\ncommunicated over third-party networks or platforms could become compromised, which could significantly harm our business even if the attack or breach does\nnot impact our systems. In addition, the management of multiple third-party vendors increases our operational complexity and decreases our control.\nOur business is subject to the effects of geopolitical events, weather, natural disasters and other conditions.\nGeopolitical events, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, floods, health pandemics, intrusion into or degradation of our infrastructure by\nhackers and other catastrophic events can have a negative effect on our business. Because of our proximity to the World Trade Center, our headquarters were\ndamaged as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Similar events or other disasters or catastrophic events in the future, and events impacting\nother sectors of the economy, including the telecommunications and energy sectors, could have a negative effect on our businesses and infrastructure, including\nour information technology systems.\nBecause we derive a portion of our revenues from travel-related spending, our business is sensitive to safety concerns related to travel and tourism, limitations\non travel and mobility, and health-related risks. In addition, disruptions in air travel and other forms of travel can result in the payment of claims under travel\ninterruption insurance policies that we offer and, if such disruptions to travel are prolonged, they can materially adversely affect overall travel-related spending.\nIf the conditions described above (or similar ones) result in widespread or lengthy disruptions to travel, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations. Card Member spending may also be negatively impacted in areas affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events. The impact of such\nevents on the overall economy may also adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\n23\nTable of Contents\nThe exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business in the United Kingdom and elsewhere may be negatively impacted by the uncertainty regarding the exit of the United Kingdom from the European\nUnion (commonly referred to as Brexit), including from a deterioration of consumer and business activity in the United Kingdom and other countries and general\nuncertainty in the overall business environment in which we operate. We may experience increased volatility in the value of the pound sterling and the euro,\nfurther strengthening the U.S. dollar, which could continue to adversely impact our results of operations from our international activities. The exit itself could also\nhave a negative impact on the United Kingdom and other European economies, which could adversely affect spending on our cards and the ability and\nwillingness of Card Members to pay amounts owed to us. As of December 31, 2016, the EMEA region constituted approximately 10 percent of our worldwide\nbilled business. It is unclear at this stage the financial, trade and legal implications of Brexit. For example, we may no longer be able to provide payment services\nfrom the United Kingdom to EU Member States, which may require changes to the structure of our business operations in Europe.\nOur success is dependent, in part, upon our executive officers and other key personnel, and the loss of key personnel could materially adversely\naffect our business.\nOur success depends, in part, on our executive officers and other key personnel. Our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be\ndifficult to replace. The market for qualified individuals is highly competitive, and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to\nreplace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel. Changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the\nadministration or enforcement of such laws or regulations can also impair our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. As further described in “Supervision\nand Regulation — Compensation Practices,” our compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the Federal Reserve and the compensation\npractices of our U.S. bank subsidiaries are subject to review and oversight by the FDIC and the OCC. This regulatory review and oversight could further affect\nour ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key personnel. The loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business.\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks\nOngoing legal proceedings regarding provisions in our merchant contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, result in additional\nlitigation and/or arbitrations, subject us to substantial monetary damages and damage our reputation and brand.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and certain states’ attorneys general brought an action against us alleging that the provisions in our card acceptance\nagreements with merchants that prohibit merchants from discriminating against our card products at the point of sale violate the U.S. antitrust laws. Visa and\nMasterCard, which were also defendants in the DOJ and state action, entered into a settlement agreement and have been dismissed as parties pursuant to that\nagreement, which was approved by the court. The settlement enjoins Visa and MasterCard from entering into contracts that prohibit merchants from engaging in\nvarious actions to steer cardholders to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale. Following a non-jury trial in the DOJ case, the trial court found\nthat the challenged provisions were anticompetitive and on April 30, 2015, the court issued a final judgment entering a permanent injunction. Following our\nappeal of this judgment, on September 26, 2016, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the trial court decision and directed the trial court to enter\na judgment for American Express, which occurred on January 25, 2017. The DOJ and states may seek further review of this ruling. We are also a defendant in a\nnumber of actions and arbitration proceedings, including proposed class actions, filed by merchants that challenge the non-discrimination and\nhonor-all-cards provisions in our card acceptance agreements and seek damages. A description of these legal proceedings is contained in “Legal Proceedings.”\nAn adverse outcome in these proceedings against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, require us to change our\nmerchant agreements in a way that could expose our cards to increased merchant steering and other forms of discrimination that could impair the Card Member\nexperience, result in additional litigation and/or arbitrations, impose substantial monetary damages and damage our reputation and brand. Even if we were not\nrequired to change our merchant agreements, changes in Visa’s and MasterCard’s policies or practices as a result of legal proceedings, lawsuit settlements or\nregulatory actions could result in changes to our business practices and materially and adversely impact our profitability.\nOur business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision, which could adversely affect our results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nWe are subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world, which significantly affects our business, and has the\npotential to restrict the scope of our existing businesses, increase our costs of doing business, limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities or make\nour products and services more expensive for customers. Regulatory oversight and supervision of our businesses are generally designed to protect consumers\nand enhance financial stability and are not designed to protect our security holders.\n24\nTable of Contents\nThe current environment of additional regulation, enhanced supervision efforts and increased and unpredictable regulatory investigations and enforcement is\nlikely to continue to result in changes to our business practices, products and procedures, and potentially additional penalties and/or restitution payments to Card\nMembers. In addition, new laws or regulations, or changes in the enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to our businesses, could impact the\nprofitability of our business activities, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities or adopt new technologies, require us to change certain of our business\npractices or alter our relationships with partners, merchants and Card Members, or affect retention of our key personnel. Such changes also may require us to\ninvest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial\ncondition. To the extent that different regulatory systems impose overlapping or inconsistent requirements on the conduct of our business, we face complexity\nand additional costs in our compliance efforts.\nIf we fail to satisfy regulatory requirements or maintain our financial holding company status, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely\naffected, and we may be restricted in our ability to take certain capital actions (such as declaring dividends or repurchasing outstanding shares) or engage in\ncertain activities or acquisitions. Additionally, our banking regulators have wide discretion in the examination and the enforcement of applicable banking statutes\nand regulations and may restrict our ability to engage in certain activities or acquisitions or require us to maintain more capital.\nIn recent years, legislators and regulators have focused on the operation of card networks, including interchange fees paid to card issuers in payment networks\nsuch as Visa and MasterCard and the fees merchants are charged to accept cards. Even where we are not directly regulated, regulation of bankcard fees can\nsignificantly negatively impact the discount revenue derived from our business, including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases\nin competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees. In some cases, such regulation extends to certain aspects of our business, for example, GNS\narrangements or terms of card acceptance for merchants, including terms relating to non-discrimination and honor-all-cards. We have brought a legal challenge\nand seek a ruling from the EU Court of Justice to clarify the interpretation and validity of the application of price caps as well as other regulatory measures in\ncircumstances where three-party networks issue cards with a cobrand partner or through an agent. There can be no assurance that our legal challenge will be\nsuccessful. For a description of certain regulations and their impact on us, see “Supervision and Regulation — Payments Regulation.” Legislators and regulators\naround the world are aware of each other’s approaches to the regulation of the payments industry. Consequently, a development in one country, state or region\nmay influence regulatory approaches in another.\nWe are subject to certain provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the Patriot Act, with regard to maintaining effective AML programs. Similar AML\nrequirements apply under the laws of most jurisdictions where we operate. Increased regulatory focus in this area could result in additional obligations or\nrestrictions with respect to the types of products and services we may offer to consumers, the countries in which our cards may be used, and the types of\ncustomers and merchants who can obtain or accept our cards. Activity such as money laundering or terrorist financing involving our cards could result in\nenforcement action, and our reputation may suffer due to our customers’ association with certain countries, persons or entities or the existence of any such\ntransactions.\nVarious regulatory agencies and legislatures are also considering regulations and legislation covering identity theft, account management guidelines, credit\nbureau reporting, disclosure rules, security and marketing that would impact us directly, in part due to increased scrutiny of our underwriting and account\nmanagement standards. These new requirements may restrict our ability to issue charge and credit cards or partner with other financial institutions, which could\nadversely affect our revenue growth.\nSee “Supervision and Regulation” for more information about certain laws and regulations to which we are subject.\nLitigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments and/or requirements resulting in significantly increased\nexpenses, damage to our reputation and/or a material adverse effect on our business.\nBusinesses in the financial services and payments industries have historically been subject to significant legal actions, including class action lawsuits. Many of\nthese actions have included claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages. While we have historically relied on our arbitration clause in agreements\nwith customers to limit our exposure to class action litigation, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause\nin the future. The CFPB issued a proposed rule that, if enacted, would, among other changes, require that our consumer arbitration clause not apply to cases\nfiled in court as class actions, unless and until class certification is denied or the class claims are dismissed. As a result, claims of the type we previously\narbitrated could be subject to the complexities and costs associated with class action cases. The continued focus of merchants on issues relating to the\nacceptance of various forms of payment may lead to additional litigation and other legal actions. Given the inherent uncertainties involved in litigation, and the\nvery large or indeterminate damages sought in some matters asserted against us, there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from\nlitigation matters.\n25\nTable of Contents\nWe have been subject to regulatory actions by the CFPB and other regulators and may continue to be subject to such actions, including governmental inquiries,\ninvestigations and enforcement proceedings, in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations. Regulatory action could subject\nus to significant fines, penalties or other requirements resulting in increased expenses, limitations or conditions on our business activities, and damage to our\nreputation and our brand, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We expect that regulators will continue taking formal\nenforcement actions against financial institutions in addition to addressing supervisory concerns through non-public supervisory actions or findings, which could\ninvolve restrictions on our activities, among other limitations that could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity rules, and if we fail to meet these rules, our business would be adversely affected.\nFailure to meet current or future capital or liquidity requirements, including those imposed by the Capital Rules, the LCR, the NSFR or by regulators in\nimplementing other portions of the Basel III framework and the enhanced supervision requirements of Dodd-Frank, could compromise our competitive position\nand could result in restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve, including limiting our ability to pay dividends, repurchase our capital stock, invest in our\nbusiness, expand our business or engage in acquisitions.\nThere continues to be substantial uncertainty regarding significant portions of the capital and liquidity regime that will apply to us and our U.S. bank subsidiaries.\nAs a result, the ultimate impact on our long-term capital and liquidity planning and our results of operations is not certain, although an increase in our capital and\nliquid asset levels could lower our return on equity.\nThe capital requirements applicable to the Company as a bank holding company and our U.S. bank subsidiaries have been substantially revised to implement\nthe international Basel III framework and are in the process of being phased in. These requirements, particularly once they are fully phased in, require the\nCompany and our U.S. bank subsidiaries to satisfy more stringent capital adequacy standards than in the past. As part of our required stress testing, both\ninternally and by the Federal Reserve, we must continue to comply with applicable capital standards in the adverse and severely adverse economic scenarios\npublished by the Federal Reserve each year. To satisfy these requirements, it may be necessary for us to hold additional capital in excess of that required by the\nCapital Rules as they are phased in.\nCompliance with capital adequacy and liquidity rules, including the Capital Rules and the LCR, requires a material investment of resources. An inability to meet\nregulatory expectations regarding our compliance with applicable capital adequacy and liquidity rules may also negatively impact the assessment of the\nCompany and our U.S. bank subsidiaries by federal banking regulators.\nWe continue to progress through the parallel run phase of Basel III advanced approaches implementation. Depending on how the advanced approaches are\nultimately implemented for our asset types, our capital ratios calculated under the advanced approaches may be lower than under the standardized approach. In\nsuch a case, we may need to hold significantly more regulatory capital in order to maintain a given capital ratio.\nThere are several recent proposals or potential proposals that could significantly impact the regulatory capital standards and requirements applicable to financial\ninstitutions such as the Company and our U.S. bank subsidiaries, as well as our ability to meet these requirements. The Basel Committee has adopted a\nframework that would impose a capital buffer on certain banks that may have an important impact on their domestic economies (so-called “domestic systemically\nimportant banks,” or “D-SIBs”). The U.S. banking regulators have not designated any D-SIBs in the United States. Additionally, the Basel Committee has\nproposed a series of revisions to the standardized approach for credit and operational risk capital requirements. If these or other proposals are adopted in the\nUnited States and applied to advanced approaches institutions or if we are designated as a D-SIB, we could be required to hold significantly more capital.\nFor more information on capital adequacy requirements, see “Capital, Leverage and Liquidity Regulation” under “Supervision and Regulation.”\nWe are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our capital stock. Our subsidiaries are also subject to restrictions\nthat limit their ability to pay dividends to us, which may adversely affect our liquidity.\nWe are limited in our ability to pay dividends and repurchase capital stock by our regulators, who have broad authority to prohibit any action that would be\nconsidered an unsafe or unsound banking practice. For example, we are subject to a requirement to submit capital plans that include, among other things,\nprojected dividend payments and repurchases of capital stock to the Federal Reserve for review. As part of the capital planning and stress testing process, our\nproposed capital actions are assessed against our ability to satisfy applicable capital requirements in the event of a stressed market environment. If the Federal\nReserve objects to our capital plan or if we fail to satisfy applicable capital requirements, our ability to undertake capital actions may be restricted.\n26\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, the Capital Rules include a capital conservation buffer which is being phased in from January 1, 2016 through January 1, 2019. The Capital Rules\nalso include a countercyclical capital buffer, which is currently set at zero but which could be increased by the Federal Reserve in the future. These buffers can\nbe satisfied only with CET1 capital. If our risk-based capital ratios were to fall below the applicable buffer levels, we would face graduated constraints on\ndividends, stock repurchases and other capital distributions based on the amount of the shortfall.\nA failure to increase dividends along with our competitors, or any reduction of, or elimination of, our common stock dividend or share repurchase program would\nlikely adversely affect the market price of our common stock and market perceptions of American Express.\nOur ability to declare or pay dividends on, or to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of our common stock will be prohibited, subject to certain\nexceptions, in the event that we do not declare and pay in full dividends for the last preceding dividend period of our Series B and Series C preferred stock.\nAmerican Express Company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for liquidity, and federal and state laws limit the amount of dividends that our subsidiaries\nmay pay to the parent company. In particular, our U.S. bank subsidiaries are subject to various statutory and regulatory limitations on their declaration and\npayment of dividends. These limitations may hinder our ability to access funds we may need to make payments on our obligations, make dividend payments on\noutstanding American Express Company capital stock or otherwise achieve strategic objectives.\nFor more information on bank holding company and depository institution dividend restrictions, see “Dividends and Other Capital Distributions” under\n“Supervision and Regulation,” as well as “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity — Share Repurchases and Dividends” under “MD&A” and Note 23 to\nour “Consolidated Financial Statements.”\nRegulation in the areas of privacy, data protection and information security could increase our costs and affect or limit our business opportunities\nand how we collect and/or use personal information.\nAs privacy, data protection and information security laws, including data localization laws, are interpreted and applied, compliance costs may increase,\nparticularly in the context of ensuring that adequate data protection and data transfer mechanisms are in place. In recent years, there has been increasing\nregulatory enforcement and litigation activity in the areas of privacy, data protection and information security in the United States and in various countries in\nwhich we operate.\nIn addition, state and federal legislators and/or regulators in the United States and other countries in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising\nprivacy, data protection and information security laws that potentially could have significant impact on our current and planned privacy, data protection and\ninformation security-related practices, our collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer and/or employee information, and some of our\ncurrent or planned business activities. New legislation or regulation could increase our costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce revenues\nfrom certain business initiatives. Moreover, the application of existing or new laws to existing technology and practices can be uncertain and may lead to\nadditional compliance risk and cost.\nCompliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information security laws relating to consumer and/or employee data could result in higher\ncompliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to fully maximize our closed-loop capability or provide certain products and services, which could\nmaterially and adversely affect our profitability. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws could result in potentially\nsignificant regulatory and/or governmental investigations and/or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions, ongoing regulatory monitoring, customer attrition, decreases\nin the use or acceptance of our cards and damage to our reputation and our brand.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage the operational and compliance risks to which we are exposed.\nWe consider operational risk to be the risk of not achieving business objectives due to inadequate or failed processes or information systems, poor data quality,\nhuman error or the external environment (e.g., natural disasters). Operational risk includes, among others, the risk that employee error or intentional misconduct\ncould result in a material financial misstatement, a failure to monitor a third party’s compliance with a service level agreement or regulatory or legal requirements,\nor a failure to adequately monitor and control access to data in our systems we grant to third-party service providers. As processes are changed, or new\nproducts and services are introduced, we may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes. Compliance risk arises\nfrom the failure to adhere to applicable laws, rules, regulations and internal policies and procedures. Operational and compliance risks can expose us to\nreputational risks as well as fines, civil money penalties or payment of damages and can lead to diminished business opportunities and diminished ability to\nexpand key operations.\n27\nTable of Contents\nIf we are not able to protect our intellectual property, our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected.\nWe rely on a variety of measures to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information, including copyrights, trademarks, patents and controls on\naccess and distribution. These measures may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights and a\nresulting loss of competitive advantage. In addition, competitors or other third parties may allege that our systems, processes or technologies infringe on their\nintellectual property rights. Given the complex, rapidly changing and competitive technological and business environments in which we operate, and the potential\nrisks and uncertainties of intellectual property-related litigation, a future assertion of an infringement claim against us could cause us to lose significant revenues,\nincur significant license, royalty or technology development expenses, or pay significant monetary damages.\nTax legislative initiatives or assessments by governmental authorities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. The laws and regulations related to tax matters are extremely\ncomplex and subject to varying interpretations. Although management believes our positions are reasonable, we are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue\nService in the United States and by tax authorities in all the jurisdictions in which we conduct business operations. We are being challenged in a number of\ncountries regarding our application of value-added taxes (VAT) to certain transactions. While we believe we comply with all applicable VAT and other tax laws,\nrules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, the tax authorities may determine that we owe additional taxes or apply existing laws and regulations more\nbroadly, which could result in a significant increase in liabilities for taxes and interest in excess of accrued liabilities.\nNew tax legislative initiatives may be proposed from time to time, such as proposals for comprehensive tax reform in the United States, which may impact our\neffective tax rate and could adversely affect our tax positions or tax liabilities. In addition, unilateral or multi-jurisdictional actions by various tax authorities,\nincluding an increase in tax audit activity, to address “base erosion and profit shifting” by multinational companies could also have an adverse impact on our tax\nliabilities.\nChanges in accounting principles or standards could adversely affect our reported financial results in a particular period, even if there are no\nunderlying changes in the economics of the business.\nWe are subject to changes in and interpretations of financial accounting matters that govern the measurement of our performance, which could change the way\nwe account for certain of our transactions even if we do not change the way in which we transact. A change in accounting guidance can have a significant effect\non our reported results, may retroactively affect previously reported results and could cause fluctuations in our reported results. For more information on recently\nissued accounting standards, see Note 1 to our “Consolidated Financial Statements.”\nCredit, Liquidity and Market Risks\nOur risk management policies and procedures may not be effective.\nOur risk management framework seeks to identify and mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return. We have established policies and procedures\nintended to identify, monitor and manage the types of risk to which we are subject, including credit risk, market risk, asset liability risk, liquidity risk, operational\nrisk, compliance risk, model risk, strategic and business risk and reputational risk. See “Risk Management” under “MD&A” for a discussion of the policies and\nprocedures we use to identify, monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our businesses. Although we have devoted significant resources to\ndevelop our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future, these policies and procedures, as well as our risk\nmanagement techniques, such as our hedging strategies, may not be fully effective. There may also be risks that exist, or develop in the future, that we have not\nappropriately anticipated, identified or mitigated. As regulations and markets in which we operate continue to evolve, our risk management framework may not\nalways keep sufficient pace with those changes. If our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks, we could suffer unexpected\nlosses and could be materially adversely affected.\nManagement of our risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical and/or forecasting models. Although we have a governance framework for model\ndevelopment and independent model validation, the modeling methodology could be erroneous or the models could be misused. If our decisions are based on\nincorrect or misused model outputs and reports, we may face adverse consequences, such as financial loss, poor business and strategic decision-making, or\ndamage to our reputation. In addition, some decisions our regulators make, including those related to our capital distribution plans, may be adversely impacted if\nthey perceive the quality of our models to be insufficient.\n28\nTable of Contents\nWe may not be able to effectively manage individual or institutional credit risk, or credit trends that can affect spending on card products and the\nability of customers and partners to pay us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to both individual credit risk, principally from consumer and small business Card Member receivables and loans, and institutional credit risk from\nmerchants, GNS partners, GCS clients, loyalty coalition partners and treasury and investment counterparties. Third parties may default on their obligations to us\ndue to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. Country, regional and political risks can contribute to credit risk. Our ability to assess\ncreditworthiness may be impaired if the criteria or models we use to manage our credit risk become less predictive of future losses, which could cause our losses\nto rise and have a negative impact on our results of operations. Rising delinquencies and rising rates of bankruptcy are often precursors of future write-offs and\nmay require us to increase our reserve for loan losses. We expect that some modest, gradual upward pressure on our write-off rates will cause provisions to\ngrow faster than loans in 2017. Higher write-off rates and the resulting increase in our reserve for loan losses adversely affect our profitability and the\nperformance of our securitizations, and may increase our cost of funds.\nAlthough we make estimates to provide for credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of loans and receivables, these estimates may not be accurate. In addition,\nthe information we use in managing our credit risk may be inaccurate or incomplete. Although we regularly review our credit exposure to specific clients and\ncounterparties and to specific industries, countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances\nthat are difficult to foresee or detect, such as fraud. In addition, our ability to manage credit risk may be adversely affected by legal or regulatory changes (such\nas bankruptcy laws and minimum payment regulations). Increased credit risk, whether resulting from underestimating the credit losses inherent in our portfolio of\nloans and receivables, deteriorating economic conditions (particularly in the United States where approximately 75 percent of our revenues are generated),\nchanges in our mix of business or otherwise, could require us to increase our provisions for losses and could have a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations and financial condition.\nAdverse financial market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital.\nWe need liquidity to pay merchants, operating and other expenses, interest on debt and dividends on capital stock and to repay maturing liabilities. The principal\nsources of our liquidity are payments from Card Members, cash flows from our investment portfolio, cash and cash equivalents, proceeds from the issuance of\nunsecured medium- and long-term notes and asset securitizations and direct and third-party sourced deposits, securitized borrowings through our secured\nfinancing facilities, a committed bank borrowing facility and the Federal Reserve discount window.\nOur ability to obtain financing in the debt capital markets for unsecured term debt and asset securitizations is dependent on market conditions. Disruptions,\nuncertainty or volatility across the financial markets, as well as adverse developments affecting our competitors and the financial industry generally, could\nnegatively impact market liquidity and limit our access to funding required to operate our business. Such market conditions may also limit our ability to replace, in\na timely manner, maturing liabilities, satisfy regulatory capital requirements and access the funding necessary to grow our business. In some circumstances, we\nmay incur an unattractive cost to raise capital, which could decrease profitability and significantly reduce financial flexibility.\nFor a further discussion of our liquidity and funding needs, see “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity — Funding Programs and Activities” under\n“MD&A.”\nAny reduction in our and our subsidiaries’ credit ratings could increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets\nand have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRating agencies regularly evaluate us and our subsidiaries, and their ratings of our and our subsidiaries’ long-term and short-term debt are based on a number\nof factors, including financial strength as well as factors not within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally, and the\nwider state of the economy. Our and our subsidiaries’ ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any of the rating agencies, which\ncould, among other things, adversely limit our access to the capital markets and adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we and our subsidiaries\nare able to obtain funding.\nAdverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease earnings we receive from our international operations and impact our\ncapital.\nDuring 2016, approximately 25 percent of our total revenues net of interest expense were generated from activities outside the United States. We are exposed to\nforeign exchange risk from our international operations, and accordingly the revenue we generate outside the United States is subject to unpredictable\nfluctuations if the values of other currencies change relative to the U.S. dollar, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For the\nyear ended December 31, 2016, foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted our net revenues of $32.1 billion by approximately\n$0.4 billion as the U.S. dollar strengthened against many currencies.\n29\nTable of Contents\nForeign exchange regulations or capital controls might restrict or prohibit the conversion of other currencies into U.S. dollars or our ability to transfer them.\nPolitical and economic conditions in other countries could also impact the availability of foreign exchange for the payment by the local card issuer of obligations\narising out of local Card Members’ spending outside such country and for the payment of card bills by Card Members who are billed in a currency other than their\nlocal currency. Substantial and sudden devaluation of local Card Members’ currency can also affect their ability to make payments to the local issuer of the card\nin connection with spending outside the local country. The occurrence of any of these circumstances could further impact our results of operations.\nContinuing concerns regarding the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political\ncircumstances in individual Eurozone countries may cause the value of the euro to fluctuate more widely than in the past and could lead to the reintroduction of\nindividual currencies in one or more Eurozone countries, or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely. If there is a\nsignificant devaluation of the euro and we are unable to hedge our foreign exchange exposure to the euro, the value of our euro-denominated assets and\nliabilities would be correspondingly reduced when translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our financial statements. Similarly, the reintroduction of certain\nindividual country currencies or the complete dissolution of the euro could adversely affect the value of our euro-denominated assets and liabilities. The\nreintroduction of individual country currencies would require us to reconfigure our billing and other systems to reflect individual country currencies in place of the\neuro. Implementing such changes could be costly and failures in the currency reconfiguration could cause disruptions in our normal business operations. In\naddition, foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge our market exposure to re-introduced currencies may not be immediately available or may not be\navailable on terms that are acceptable to us.\nThe potential developments regarding Europe and the euro, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could continue to have an adverse\nimpact on consumer and business behavior in Europe and globally, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nInterest rate increases could materially adversely affect our earnings.\nIf the rate of interest we pay on our borrowings increases more than the rate of interest we earn on our loans, our net interest yield, and consequently our net\nincome, could fall. Our interest expense was approximately $1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market\ninterest rates would have resulted in a decrease to our annual net interest income of approximately $193 million as of December 31, 2016. In addition, interest\nrate changes may affect customer behavior, such as impacting the loan balances Card Members carry on their credit cards or their ability to make payments as\nhigher interest rates lead to higher payment requirements, further impacting our results of operations.\nFor a further discussion of our interest rate risk, see “Risk Management — Market Risk Management Process” under “MD&A.”\nThe value of our assets or liabilities may be adversely impacted by economic, political or market conditions.\nMarket risk includes the loss in value of portfolios and financial instruments due to adverse changes in market variables, which could negatively impact our\nfinancial condition. We held approximately $3.2 billion of investment securities as of December 31, 2016. In the event that actual default rates of these\ninvestment securities were to significantly change from historical patterns due to challenges in the economy or otherwise, it could have a material adverse impact\non the value of our investment portfolio. Defaults or economic disruptions, even in countries or territories in which we do not have material investment exposure,\nconduct business or have operations, could adversely affect us.\nAn inability to accept or maintain deposits due to market demand or regulatory constraints could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and\nour ability to fund our business.\nOur U.S. bank subsidiaries accept deposits from individuals through third-party brokerage networks as well as directly from consumers through American\nExpress Personal Savings, and use the proceeds as a source of funding. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $52.3 billion in total U.S. retail\ndeposits, of which a significant amount had been raised through third-party brokerage networks. We face strong competition with regard to deposits, and pricing\nand product changes may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain cost-effective deposit balances. If we are required to offer higher interest rates to\nattract or maintain deposits, our funding costs will be adversely impacted.\nOur ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates on deposits is also dependent on capital levels of our U.S. bank subsidiaries. The FDIA’s\nbrokered deposit provisions and related FDIC rules in certain circumstances prohibit banks from accepting or renewing brokered deposits and apply other\nrestrictions, such as a cap on interest rates that can be paid. See “Prompt Corrective Action” under “Supervision and Regulation” for additional information.\n30\nTable of Contents\nWhile Centurion Bank and American Express Bank were considered “well capitalized” as of December 31, 2016 and had no restrictions regarding acceptance of\nbrokered deposits or setting of interest rates, there can be no assurance they will continue to meet this definition. The Capital Rules, particularly when fully\nphased in, require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital, with a greater emphasis on common equity.\nAdditionally, our regulators can adjust the requirements to be “well capitalized” at any time and have authority to place limitations on our deposit businesses,\nincluding the interest rates we pay on deposits. An inability to attract or maintain deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and\nour ability to fund our business.",

      "item1a":"This section highlights specific risks that could affect us and our businesses. You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other\ninformation set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on the information currently known to us, we believe the following information identifies the\nmost significant risk factors affecting us. However, the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below. Additional risks and uncertainties\nnot presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.\nIf any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events or if the circumstances described in the risks and uncertainties occur or continue to occur,\nthese events or circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. These events could also have a\nnegative effect on the trading price of our securities.\nStrategic, Business and Competitive Risks\nDifficult conditions in the business and economic environment, as well as political conditions in the United States and elsewhere, may materially adversely\naffect our business and results of operations.\nOur results of operations are materially affected by economic, market, political and social conditions in the United States and abroad. We offer a broad array of\nproducts and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients and thus are very dependent upon the level of consumer and business activity and the\ndemand for payment and financing products. Slow economic growth or deterioration in economic conditions could change customer behaviors, including spending\non our cards and the ability and willingness of Card Members to borrow and pay amounts owed to us. Political conditions in certain regions or countries could also\nnegatively affect consumer and business spending, including in other parts of the world.\nFactors such as consumer spending and confidence, unemployment rates, business investment, government spending, interest rates, taxes (including the broad and\ncomplex changes made by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to the U.S. tax code), fuel and other energy costs, the volatility and strength of the capital markets, inflation\nand deflation all affect the economic environment and, ultimately, our profitability. Such factors may also cause our earnings, billings, loan balances, credit metrics\nand margins to fluctuate and diverge from expectations of analysts and investors, who may have differing assumptions regarding their impact on our business,\nadversely affecting, and/or increasing the volatility of, the trading price of our common shares.\n16\nTable of Contents\nTravel and entertainment expenditures, which comprised approximately 25 percent of our U.S. billed business during 2017, for example, are sensitive to business\nand personal discretionary spending levels and tend to decline during general economic downturns. Likewise, spending by small businesses and corporate clients,\nwhich comprised approximately 40 percent of our worldwide billed business during 2017, depends in part on the economic environment and a favorable climate\nfor continued business investment and new business formation. Increases in delinquencies and write-off rates as a result of increases in bankruptcies,\nunemployment rates, changes in customer behaviors or otherwise could also have a negative impact on our results of operations. The consequences of negative\ncircumstances impacting us or the environment generally can be sudden and severe.\nOur operating results may suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payments industry.\nThe payments industry is highly competitive, and we compete with charge, credit and debit card networks, issuers and acquirers, paper-based transactions (e.g.,\ncash and checks), bank transfer models (e.g., wire transfers and ACH), as well as evolving and growing alternative, non-traditional payment and financing\nproviders.\nWe believe Visa and MasterCard are larger than we are in most countries. As a result, card issuers and acquirers on the Visa and MasterCard networks may be able\nto benefit from the dominant position, scale, resources, marketing and pricing of those networks. Our business may also be increasingly negatively affected if we\nare unable to increase merchant acceptance and our cards are not accepted at merchants that accept cards on the Visa and MasterCard networks.\nSome of our competitors have developed, or may develop, for example, as a result of the recent reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate, substantially greater\nfinancial and other resources than we have and may offer richer value propositions or a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more\neffective advertising, marketing or cross-selling strategies to acquire and retain more customers, capture a greater share of spending and borrowings, establish and\ndevelop more attractive cobrand card and other partner programs and maintain greater merchant acceptance than we have. We may not be able to compete\neffectively against these threats or respond or adapt to changes in consumer spending habits as effectively as our competitors. We expect expenses such as Card\nMember rewards and Card Member services expenses to continue to increase as we improve our value propositions for Card Members, including in response to\nincreased competition.\nSpending on our cards could continue to be impacted by increasing consumer usage of charge, credit and debit cards issued on other networks, as well as adoption\nof alternative payment systems. To the extent other payment mechanisms, systems and products continue to successfully expand, our discount revenues and our\nability to access transaction data through our integrated network could be negatively impacted. The competitive value of our closed-loop data may also be\ndiminished as traditional and non-traditional competitors use other, new data sources and technologies to derive similar insights. If we are not able to differentiate\nourselves from our competitors, develop compelling value propositions for our customers and/or effectively grow in areas such as mobile and online payments and\nemerging technologies, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nTo the extent we expand into new business areas and new geographic regions, we may face competitors with more experience and more established relationships\nwith relevant customers, regulators and industry participants, which could adversely affect our ability to compete. We may face additional compliance and\nregulatory risk to the extent that we expand into new business areas , and we may need to dedicate more expense, time and resources to comply with regulatory\nrequirements than our competitors, particularly those that are not regulated financial institutions. In addition, companies that control access to consumer and\nmerchant payment method choices through digital wallets, commerce-related experiences, mobile applications or other technologies, or at the point of sale could\nchoose not to accept, suppress use of, or degrade the experience of using our products or could restrict our access to our customers and transaction data. Such\ncompanies could also require payments from us to participate in such digital wallets, experiences or applications, impacting our profitability on transactions. Laws\nand business practices that favor local competitors, require card transactions to be routed over domestic networks or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain\nbusinesses could slow our growth in international regions. Further, expanding our service offerings, adding customer acquisition channels and forming new\npartnerships could have higher costs than our current arrangements, and could adversely impact our average discount rate or dilute our brand.\nMany of our competitors are subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes. More restrictive laws and regulations that do\nnot apply to all of our competitors can put us at a competitive disadvantage, including prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions, regulating our contract\nterms and practices governing merchant card acceptance or adversely affecting our cost structure. See “ Ongoing legal proceedings regarding provisions in our\nmerchant contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, result in additional litigation and/or arbitrations, subject us to substantial monetary\ndamages and damage our reputation and brand ” for a discussion of the potential impact on our ability to compete effectively if ongoing legal proceedings limit\nour ability to prevent merchants from engaging in various actions to discriminate against our card products.\n17\nTable of Contents\nWe face substantial and increasingly intense competition for partner relationships, which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that\ncould have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nIn the ordinary course of our business we enter into different types of contractual arrangements with business partners in a variety of industries. For example, we\nhave partnered with Delta Air Lines, as well as many others globally, to offer cobranded cards for consumers and small businesses, and through our Membership\nRewards program we have partnered with businesses in many industries, including the airline industry, to offer benefits to Card Member participants. Competition\nfor relationships with key business partners is very intense and there can be no assurance we will be able to grow or maintain these partner relationships or that\nthey will remain as profitable. Establishing and retaining attractive cobrand card partnerships is particularly competitive among card issuers and networks as these\npartnerships typically appeal to high-spending loyal customers. Our entire cobrand portfolio accounted for approximately 16 percent of our worldwide billed\nbusiness for the year ended December 31, 2017. Card Member loans related to our cobrand portfolio accounted for approximately 36 percent of our worldwide\nCard Member loans as of December 31, 2017 . Delta cobrand accounts, our largest cobrand portfolio, accounted for approximately 8 percent of our worldwide\nbilled business for the year ended December 31, 2017 and approximately 21 percent of worldwide Card Member loans as of December 31, 2017. Our relationships\nwith, and revenues related to, Delta extend beyond cobrand accounts and include merchant acceptance of American Express cards, participation in our Membership\nRewards program and travel-related benefits and services.\nCobrand arrangements are entered into for a fixed period, generally ranging from five to eight years, and will terminate in accordance with their terms, including at\nthe end of the fixed period unless extended or renewed at the option of the parties, or upon early termination as a result of an event of default or otherwise. We face\nthe risk that we could lose partner relationships, even after we have invested significant resources in the relationships. The volume of billed business could decline\nand Card Member attrition could increase, in each case, significantly as a result of the termination of one or more cobrand partnership relationships. In addition,\nsome of our cobrand arrangements provide that, upon expiration or termination, the cobrand partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the loans\ngenerated with respect to its program, which could result in a significant decline in our Card Member loans outstanding. For example, our U.S. cobrand\nrelationship with Costco ended in 2016, and we sold the outstanding Card Member loans associated with the Costco portfolio.\nWe also face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us as competition for such relationships continues to increase. We\nmake payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on\nsuch spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. The amount we pay to our cobrand partners has increased,\nparticularly in the United States, and may continue to increase as arrangements are renegotiated due to increasingly intense competition for cobrand partners\namong card issuers and networks. We may also choose to not continue certain cobrand relationships.\nThe loss of exclusivity arrangements with business partners or the loss of business partners altogether (whether by non-renewal at the end of the contract period,\nsuch as the end of our relationship with Costco in the United States in 2016, or as the result of a merger or otherwise, such as the withdrawal of American Airlines\nin 2014 from our Airport Club Access program for Centurion ® and Platinum Card ® Members) or the renegotiation of existing partnerships with terms that are\nsignificantly worse for us could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. In addition, any publicity associated with the loss of any\nof our key business partners could harm our reputation, making it more difficult to attract and retain Card Members and merchants, and could weaken our\nnegotiating position with our remaining and prospective business partners.\nWe face continued intense competitive pressure that may impact the prices we charge merchants that accept our cards for payment for goods and services.\nUnlike our competitors in the payments industry that rely on revolving credit balances to drive profits, our business model is focused on Card Member spending.\nDiscount revenue, which represents fees generally charged to merchants when Card Members use their cards to purchase goods and services on our network, is\nprimarily driven by billed business volumes and is our largest single revenue source. In recent years, we experienced some reduction in our global weighted\naverage merchant discount rate and have been under increasing pressure, including as a result of regulatory-mandated reductions to competitors’ pricing, to reduce\nmerchant discount rates and undertake other repricing initiatives. We also face pressure from competitors that have other sources of income or lower costs that can\nmake their pricing more attractive to key business partners and merchants. Merchants are also able to negotiate incentives and pricing concessions from us as a\ncondition to accepting our cards or being cobrand partners. As merchants consolidate and become even larger, we may have to increase the amount of incentives\nand/or concessions we provide to certain merchants, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Competitive and regulatory pressures on\npricing could make it difficult to offset the costs of these incentives. We also expect further erosion of our average merchant discount rate as we seek to increase\nmerchant acceptance. We may not be successful in significantly expanding merchant acceptance or offsetting rate erosion with volumes at new merchants.\nIn addition, the regulatory environment and differentiated payment models and technologies from non-traditional players in the alternative payments space could\npose challenges to our traditional payment model and adversely impact our average merchant discount rate. Some merchants continue to invest in their own\npayment solutions, such as proprietary-branded mobile wallets, using both traditional and new technology platforms. If merchants are able to drive broad consumer\nadoption and usage, it could adversely impact our average merchant discount rate and billed business volumes.\n18\nTable of Contents\nA continuing priority of ours is to drive greater and differentiated value to our merchants which, if not successful, could negatively impact our discount revenue\nand financial results. If the average merchant discount rate declines more than expected, we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing\nbilled business volumes, increasing other sources of revenue, such as fee-based revenue or interest income, or both. We may not succeed in maintaining merchant\ndiscount rates or offsetting the impact of declining merchant discount rates, particularly in the current regulatory environment, which could materially and\nadversely affect our revenues and profitability, and therefore our ability to invest in innovation and in value-added services for merchants and Card Members.\nSurcharging or steering by merchants could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn certain countries, such as Australia and certain Member States in the EU, merchants are expressly permitted by law to surcharge certain card purchases. In\naddition, the laws of a number of states in the United States that prohibit surcharging have been overturned in litigation brought by merchant groups. In\njurisdictions allowing surcharging, we have seen merchant surcharging on American Express cards in certain merchant categories, and in some cases, either the\nsurcharge is greater than that applied to Visa and MasterCard cards or Visa and MasterCard cards are not surcharged at all, practices that are known as differential\nsurcharging, even though there are many cards issued on competing networks that have an equal or greater cost of acceptance for the merchant.\nWe also encounter merchants that accept our cards, but tell their customers that they prefer to accept another type of payment or otherwise seek to suppress use of\nour cards. Our Card Members value the ability to use their cards where and when they want to, and we, therefore, take steps to meet our Card Members’\nexpectations and to protect the American Express brand by prohibiting this form of discrimination, subject to local legal requirements.\nIf surcharging, steering or other forms of discrimination become widespread, American Express cards and credit and charge cards generally could become less\ndesirable to consumers, which could result in a decrease in cards-in-force and transaction volumes. The impact could vary depending on such factors as the manner\nin which a surcharge is levied, how Card Members are steered to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale and whether and to what extent these\nactions are applied to other payment cards, including whether it varies depending on the type of card, network, acquirer or issuer. Discrimination against American\nExpress cards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly to the extent it disproportionately\nimpacts our Card Members.\n If we are not able to invest successfully in, and compete at the leading edge of, technological developments across all our businesses, our revenue and\nprofitability could be negatively affected.\nOur industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes. In order to compete in our industry, we need to continue to invest across all areas of our\nbusiness, including in transaction processing, data management and analytics, customer interactions and communications, alternative payment mechanisms,\nauthentication technologies and risk management and compliance systems. Incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial\nexpenditures and take considerable time, and ultimately may not be successful. We expect that new technologies in the payments industry will continue to emerge,\nand these new technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our products and services.\nThe process of developing new products and services, enhancing existing products and services and adapting to technological changes and evolving industry\nstandards is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could\nsignificantly impede our ability to compete effectively. Consumer and merchant adoption is a key competitive factor and our competitors may develop products,\nplatforms or technologies that become more widely adopted than ours. In addition, we may underestimate the time and expense we must invest in new products\nand services before they generate material revenues, if at all.\nOur ability to develop, acquire or access competitive technologies or business processes on acceptable terms may also be limited by intellectual property rights that\nthird parties, including competitors and potential competitors, may assert. In addition, our ability to adopt new technologies may be inhibited by a need for\nindustry-wide standards, a changing legislative and regulatory environment, the need for internal product and engineering expertise, resistance to change from Card\nMembers or merchants, or the complexity of our systems.\n19\nTable of Contents\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to promote card usage through marketing and promotion, merchant acceptance and Card Member rewards and\nservices, or to effectively control the costs of such investments, both of which may impact our profitability.\nRevenue growth is dependent on increasing consumer and business spending on our cards and growing loan balances. We have been investing in a number of\ngrowth initiatives over the past several years, including to attract new Card Members, reduce Card Member attrition and capture a greater share of customers’ total\nspending and borrowings. There can be no assurance that our investments to acquire Card Members, provide differentiated features and services and increase usage\nof our cards will be effective. For example, we may not be successful in developing and issuing new and enhanced cards or customers may not accept or be willing\nto pay for our new products and services, which would negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, if we develop new products or offers that attract\ncustomers looking for short-term incentives rather than incentivize long-term loyalty, Card Member attrition and costs could increase. Increasing spending on our\ncards also depends on our continued expansion of merchant acceptance of our cards. If the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows or reverses itself, our\nbusiness could suffer.\nAnother way we invest in customer value is through our Membership Rewards program, as well as other Card Member benefits. Any significant change in, or\nfailure by management to reasonably estimate, actual redemptions of Membership Rewards points and associated redemption costs could adversely affect our\nprofitability. In addition, many credit card issuers have instituted rewards and cobrand programs and may introduce programs and services that are similar to or\nmore attractive than ours. Our inability to continue to differentiate our products and services generally could materially adversely affect us.\nWe may not be able to cost-effectively manage and expand Card Member benefits, including containing the growth of marketing, promotion, rewards and Card\nMember services expenses in the future. If such expenses continue to increase beyond our expectations, we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by\nincreasing payments volume, increasing other areas of revenues such as fee-based revenues, or both. We may not succeed in doing so, particularly in the current\ncompetitive and regulatory environment.\nOur brand and reputation are key assets of our Company, and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace.\nOur brand and its attributes are key assets, and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brand. Our\nability to attract and retain consumer and small business Card Members and corporate clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of\nservice, trustworthiness, business practices, management, workplace culture, merchant acceptance, financial condition, our response to unexpected events and other\nsubjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters—even if related to seemingly isolated incidents and whether or not factually correct\n—could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential Card Members and corporate clients, which could make it difficult for\nus to attract new Card Members and customers and maintain existing ones. Negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of\nactivities or circumstances, including card practices, regulatory compliance and the use and protection of customer information, and from actions taken by\nregulators or others in response to such conduct. Social media channels can also cause rapid, widespread reputational harm to our brand.\nOur brand and reputation may also be harmed by actions taken by third parties that are outside our control. For example, any shortcoming of or controversy related\nto a third-party vendor, merchant acquirer or GNS partner may be attributed by Card Members and merchants to us, thus damaging our reputation and brand value.\nThe lack of acceptance or suppression of card usage by merchants can also negatively impact perceptions of our brand and our products, lower overall transaction\nvolume and increase the attractiveness of other payment products or systems. Adverse developments with respect to our industry may also, by association,\nnegatively impact our reputation, or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us. Furthermore, as a corporation with headquarters and\noperations located in the United States, a negative perception of the United States arising from its political or other positions could harm the perception of our\ncompany and our brand. Although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand, negative perceptions or publicity could\nmaterially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nA significant operating disruption, a major information or cyber security incident or an increase in fraudulent activity could lead to reputational damage to\nour brand and significant legal, regulatory and financial exposure, and could reduce the use and acceptance of our charge and credit cards.\nWe and other third parties process, transmit, store and provide access to account information in connection with our charge and credit cards, and prepaid and other\nproducts, and in the normal course of our business, we collect, analyze and retain significant volumes of certain types of personally identifiable and other\ninformation pertaining to our customers and employees.\n20\nTable of Contents\nGlobal financial institutions like us have experienced a significant increase in information and cyber security risk in recent years and will likely continue to be the\ntarget of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, including computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, ransomware, social engineering attacks (including\nphishing and impersonation), hacking, denial-of-service attacks and other attacks and similar disruptions from the unauthorized use of or access to computer\nsystems. For example, we and other U.S. financial services providers have been the targets of distributed denial-of-service attacks from sophisticated third parties.\nOur networks and systems are subject to constant attempts to identify and exploit potential vulnerabilities in our operating environment with intent to disrupt our\nbusiness operations and capture, destroy or manipulate various types of information relating to corporate trade secrets, customer information, including Card\nMember, travel and loyalty program account information, employee information and other sensitive business information, including acquisition activity, financial\nresults and intellectual property. There are a number of motivations for cyber threat actors, including criminal activities such as fraud, identity theft and ransom,\ncorporate or nation-state espionage, political agendas, public embarrassment with the intent to cause financial or reputational harm, intent to disrupt information\ntechnology systems, and to expose and exploit potential security and privacy vulnerabilities in corporate systems and websites.\nAs outsourcing, specialization of functions, third-party digital services and technology innovation within the payments industry increase (including with respect to\nmobile technologies, tokenization, big data and cloud storage solutions), more third parties are involved in processing card transactions and there is a risk the\nconfidentiality, integrity, privacy and/or security of data held by, or accessible to, third parties, including merchants that accept our cards, payment processors and\nour business partners, may be compromised, which could lead to unauthorized transactions on our cards and costs associated with responding to such an incident.\nIn addition, high profile data breaches such as the one announced in 2017 by Equifax, one of the three major credit reporting agencies in the United States, could\nchange consumer behaviors, impact our ability to access data to make product offers and credit decisions and result in legislation and additional regulatory\nrequirements.\nWe develop and maintain systems and processes aimed at detecting and preventing information and cyber security incidents and fraudulent activity, which require\nsignificant investment, maintenance and ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and regulatory requirements change and as efforts to overcome security\nmeasures become more sophisticated. Despite our efforts, the possibility of information and cyber security incidents, malicious social engineering, fraudulent or\nother malicious activities and human error or malfeasance cannot be eliminated entirely. Risks associated with each of these remain, including the unauthorized\ndisclosure, release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, modification, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary or other information (including account data\ninformation) or negative impact to online accounts and systems. These risks will likely evolve as new technology is deployed. For example, with the increased use\nof EMV technology, we may see a decrease in traditional fraud risk, but sophisticated fraudsters may develop new ways to commit fraud and we may see an\nincrease in online fraud and impersonation and identity takeover attempts.\nOur information technology systems, including our transaction authorization, clearing and settlement systems, and data centers may experience service disruptions\nor degradation because of technology malfunction, sudden increases in customer transaction volume, natural disasters, accidents, power outages, internet outages,\ntelecommunications failures, fraud, denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, terrorism, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or similar events.\nService disruptions could prevent access to our online services and account information, compromise Company or customer data, and impede transaction\nprocessing and financial reporting. Inadequate infrastructure in lesser-developed countries could also result in service disruptions, which could impact our ability to\ndo business in those countries.\nIf our information technology systems experience a significant disruption or breach, or if actual or perceived fraud levels or other illegal activities involving our\ncards, customer online accounts or systems were to rise due to an information or cyber security incident at a business partner, merchant or other market participant,\nemployee error, malfeasance or otherwise, it could lead to the loss of data or data integrity, regulatory investigations and intervention (such as mandatory card\nreissuance), increased litigation (including class action litigation), remediation and response costs, greater concerns of customers and/or business partners relating\nto the privacy and security of their data, and reputational and financial damage to our brand, which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards, and have a\nmaterial adverse impact on our business.\nIf such disruptions or breaches are not detected quickly, their effect could be compounded. Information or cyber security incidents and other actual or perceived\nfailures to maintain confidentiality, integrity, privacy and/or security, including leaked business data, may also disrupt our operations, undermine our competitive\nadvantage through the disclosure of sensitive company information, divert management attention and resources, and negatively impact the assessment of us and\nour subsidiaries by banking regulators and rating agencies.\nSuccessful cyberattacks or data breaches at other large financial institutions, large retailers or other market participants, whether or not we are impacted, could lead\nto a general loss of customer confidence that could negatively affect us, including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or\nharming the reputation of the financial system in general, which could result in reduced use of our products and services. Although we have insurance for losses\nrelated to cyber risks and attacks and information and cyber security and privacy liability, it may not be sufficient to offset the impact of a material loss event.\n21\nTable of Contents\nWe have agreements with business partners in a variety of industries, including the airline industry, that represent a significant portion of our business. We\nare exposed to risks associated with these industries, including bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings, consolidations and alliances of our partners, and the\npossible obligation to make payments to our partners.\nWe may be obligated to make or accelerate payments to certain business partners such as cobrand partners upon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as\na shortfall in certain performance and revenue levels. If we are not able to effectively manage these triggering events, we could unexpectedly have to make\npayments to these partners, which could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are also exposed to risk from bankruptcies, liquidations, insolvencies, financial distress, restructurings, consolidations and other similar events that may occur\nin any industry representing a significant portion of our billed business, which could negatively impact particular card products and services (and billed business\ngenerally) and our financial condition and results of operations. For example, we could be materially impacted if we were obligated to or elected to reimburse Card\nMembers for products and services purchased from merchants that have ceased operations or stopped accepting our cards.\nWe are exposed to credit risk in the airline industry, which accounted for approximately 8 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended December\n31, 2017 , to the extent we protect Card Members against non-delivery of goods and services, such as where we have remitted payment to an airline for a Card\nMember purchase of tickets that have not yet been used or “flown.” If we are unable to collect the amount from the airline, we may bear the loss for the amount\ncredited to the Card Member.\nFor additional information relating to the general risks related to the airline industry, see “Risk Management—Institutional Credit Risk—Exposure to the Airline\nIndustry” under “MD&A.”\nWe may not be successful in realizing the benefits associated with our acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and investment activity, and our business\nand reputation could be negatively impacted.\nWe have acquired a number of businesses and have made a number of strategic investments, and continue to evaluate potential transactions. These transactions\ncould be material to our financial condition and results of operations. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify and secure future\nacquisition candidates on terms and conditions that are acceptable to us or complete proposed acquisitions and investments, which could impair our growth. The\nprocess of integrating an acquired company, business or technology could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, result in unanticipated\nliabilities and harm our business generally. It may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions, and those benefits may\nultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could adversely affect our business and operating results, including as a result of writedowns of goodwill and other intangible assets.\nWe may also face risks with other types of strategic transactions, such as the sale to InComm of the operations relating to our prepaid reloadable and gift card\nbusiness in the United States, which is still subject to final agreement on the program management and issuer processing arrangements. If that transaction is\nconsummated, we could experience disruption in our ability to service our prepaid customers if InComm’s services are interrupted, suspended or terminated for\nany reason, which could result in additional costs, regulatory risks and harm to our business and reputation.\nJoint ventures, including our GBT JV, and minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially\nincreasing the financial, legal, operational and/or compliance risks associated with the joint venture or minority investment. In addition, we may be dependent on\njoint venture partners, controlling shareholders or management who may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours. Business\ndecisions or other actions or omissions of the joint venture partner, controlling shareholders or management may adversely affect the value of our investment,\nresult in litigation or regulatory action against us and otherwise damage our reputation and brand.\nWe rely on third-party providers for acquiring customers, technology, platforms and other services integral to the operations of our businesses. These third\nparties may act in ways that could harm our business.\nWe rely on third-party service providers, merchants, customer acquisition channels, processors, aggregators, GNS partners and other third parties for services that\nare integral to our operations and are subject to the risk that activities of such third parties may adversely affect our business. For example, we rely on third parties\nfor the timely transmission of accurate information across our global network, card acquisition and provision of services to our customers. If a service provider or\nother third party ceases to provide the data quality or communications capacity we expect or services upon which we rely, as a result of natural disaster, operational\ndisruptions or errors, terrorism, information or cyber security incidents, or any other reason, the failure could interrupt or compromise the quality of our services to\ncustomers or impact our ability to grow our business. There is also a risk the confidentiality, integrity, privacy and/or security of data held by, or accessible to,\nthird parties or communicated over third-party networks or platforms could become compromised, which could significantly harm our business even if the attack\nor breach does not impact our systems. We are also exposed to the risk that a disruption or other event at a service provider to one of our service providers or\npartners could impede their ability to provide to us services or data on which we rely to operate our business. Service providers or other third parties could also\ncease providing data to us if we are unable to negotiate for data use rights or use our data for purposes that do not benefit us, which could diminish the competitive\nvalue of our closed loop.\n22\nTable of Contents\nThe management of multiple third-party vendors increases our operational complexity and decreases our control. A failure to exercise adequate oversight over\nthird-party service providers, including compliance with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements, could result in regulatory actions, fines,\nsanctions or economic and reputational harm to us. In addition, we may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate operational risks relating to our vendors’\nservice providers.\nOur business is subject to the effects of geopolitical events, weather, natural disasters and other conditions.\nGeopolitical events, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, floods, health pandemics, information or cyber security incidents (including\nintrusion into or degradation of systems or technology by cyberattackers) and other catastrophic events can have a negative effect on our business. Because of our\nproximity to the World Trade Center, our headquarters were damaged as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. In 2017, hurricanes impacted\nspending and credit performance in the areas affected. Similar events or other disasters or catastrophic events in the future, and events impacting other sectors of\nthe economy, including the telecommunications and energy sectors, could have a negative effect on our businesses and infrastructure, including our technology and\nsystems. Card Members in California, New York, Florida, Texas and Georgia account for a significant portion of U.S. Consumer billed business and Card\nMembers loans, and our results of operations could be impacted by events or conditions that disproportionately or specifically affect one or more of those states.\nBecause we derive a portion of our revenues from travel-related spending, our business is sensitive to safety concerns related to travel and tourism, limitations on\ntravel and mobility, and health-related risks. In addition, disruptions in air travel and other forms of travel can result in the payment of claims under travel\ninterruption insurance policies we offer and, if such disruptions to travel are prolonged, they can materially adversely affect overall travel-related spending.\nIf the conditions described above (or similar ones) result in widespread or lengthy disruptions to travel, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations. Card Member spending may also be negatively impacted in areas affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events. The impact of such events\non the overall economy may also adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business in the United Kingdom and elsewhere may be negatively impacted by the uncertainty regarding the exit of the United Kingdom from the European\nUnion (commonly referred to as Brexit), including from a deterioration of consumer and business activity in the United Kingdom and other countries and general\nuncertainty in the overall business environment in which we operate. We may experience increased volatility in the value of the pound sterling and the euro, further\nstrengthening the U.S. dollar, which could continue to adversely impact our results of operations from our international activities. The exit itself could also have a\nnegative impact on the United Kingdom and other European economies, which could adversely affect spending on our cards and the ability and willingness of Card\nMembers to pay amounts owed to us. As of December 31, 2017, the EMEA region constituted approximately 11 percent of our worldwide billed business. It is\nunclear at this stage the financial, trade and legal implications of Brexit, although we expect to make changes to the structure of our business operations in Europe\nas a result.\nOur success is dependent, in part, upon our executive officers and other key personnel, and the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our\nbusiness.\nOur success depends, in part, on our executive officers and other key personnel. Our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be\ndifficult to replace. We rely upon our key personnel not only for business success, but also to lead with integrity. To the extent our leaders behave in a manner that\ndoes not comport with our company’s values, the consequences to our brand and reputation could be severe and could negatively affect our financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nThe market for qualified individuals is highly competitive, and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed\nmembers of our senior management team or other key personnel. Changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or\nenforcement of such laws or regulations can also impair our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, or to employ such personnel in the location(s) of our\nchoice. As further described in “Supervision and Regulation—Compensation Practices,” our compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the\nFederal Reserve and the compensation practices of our U.S. bank subsidiaries are subject to review and oversight by the FDIC and the OCC. This regulatory\nreview and oversight could further affect our ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key personnel. The loss of key personnel could materially\nadversely affect our business.\n23\nTable of Contents\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks\nOngoing legal proceedings regarding provisions in our merchant contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, result in additional litigation\nand/or arbitrations, subject us to substantial monetary damages and damage our reputation and brand.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and certain states’ attorneys general brought an action against us alleging that the provisions in our card acceptance\nagreements with merchants that prohibit merchants from discriminating against our card products violate the U.S. antitrust laws. Following a non-jury trial in the\ncase, the trial court found that the challenged provisions were anticompetitive and issued a final judgment entering a permanent injunction. Following our appeal of\nthis judgment, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the trial court decision and directed the trial court to enter a judgment for American Express.\nEleven of the 17 states that are party to the case filed a petition with the Supreme Court seeking a review of the Second Circuit’s decision. On October 16, 2017,\nthe Supreme Court granted certiorari and oral argument is scheduled for February 26, 2018. We are also a defendant in a number of actions and arbitration\nproceedings, including proposed class actions, filed by merchants that challenge the non-discrimination and honor-all-cards provisions in our card acceptance\nagreements and seek damages. A description of these legal proceedings is contained in “Legal Proceedings.”\nAn adverse outcome in these proceedings against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, require us to change our\nmerchant agreements in a way that could expose our cards to increased merchant steering and other forms of discrimination that could impair the Card Member\nexperience, result in additional litigation and/or arbitrations, impose substantial monetary damages and damage our reputation and brand. Even if we were not\nrequired to change our merchant agreements, changes in Visa’s and MasterCard’s policies or practices as a result of legal proceedings, lawsuit settlements or\nregulatory actions pending against them could result in changes to our business practices and materially and adversely impact our profitability.\nOur business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nWe are subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world, which significantly affects our business, and has the\npotential to restrict the scope of our existing businesses, increase our costs of doing business, limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, require\nchanges to business practices, affect our relationships with partners, merchants and Card Members, or make our products and services more expensive for\ncustomers. Regulatory oversight and supervision of our businesses are generally designed to protect consumers and enhance financial stability and are not designed\nto protect our security holders.\nNew laws or regulations, enhanced supervision efforts or changes in the enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to our businesses could impact the\nprofitability of our business activities, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities or adopt new technologies, require us to change certain of our business\npractices or alter our relationships with partners, merchants and Card Members, or affect retention of our key personnel. Such changes also may require us to invest\nsignificant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nLegislators and regulators around the world are aware of each other’s approaches to the regulation of the payments industry. Consequently, a development in one\ncountry, state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another. To the extent that different regulatory systems impose overlapping or inconsistent\nrequirements on the conduct of our business, we face complexity and additional costs in our compliance efforts.\nIf we fail to satisfy regulatory requirements or maintain our financial holding company status, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely\naffected, and we may be restricted in our ability to take certain capital actions (such as declaring dividends or repurchasing outstanding shares) or engage in certain\nactivities or acquisitions. Additionally, our banking regulators have wide discretion in the examination and the enforcement of applicable banking statutes and\nregulations and may restrict our ability to engage in certain activities or acquisitions or require us to maintain more capital.\nIn recent years, legislators and regulators have focused on the operation of card networks, including interchange fees paid to card issuers in payment networks such\nas Visa and MasterCard and the fees merchants are charged to accept cards. Even where we are not directly regulated, regulation of bankcard fees can significantly\nnegatively impact the discount revenue derived from our business, including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor\npricing in connection with caps on interchange fees. In some cases, regulations extend to certain aspects of our business, such as GNS and cobrand arrangements or\nterms of card acceptance for merchants, including terms relating to non-discrimination and honor-all-cards. For example, regulations in the EU and Australia have\nundermined our GNS business in those jurisdictions and have resulted in the moderation of GNS billed business growth. In addition, there is uncertainty as to when\nor how interchange fee cap provisions and other provisions might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the EU following a ruling from the EU\nCourt of Justice, and there can be no assurance we will be able to maintain such relationships in their current form.\n24\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to certain provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the Patriot Act, with regard to maintaining effective AML programs. Similar AML\nrequirements apply under the laws of most jurisdictions where we operate. Increased regulatory focus in this area could result in additional obligations or\nrestrictions with respect to the types of products and services we may offer to consumers, the countries in which our cards may be used, and the types of customers\nand merchants who can obtain or accept our cards. Activity such as money laundering or terrorist financing involving our cards could result in enforcement action,\nand our reputation may suffer due to our customers’ association with certain countries, persons or entities or the existence of any such transactions.\nU.S. federal law regulates abusive debt collection practices, which, along with bankruptcy and debtor relief laws, can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to\nus or subject us to regulatory scrutiny. Our ability to recover debt we had previously written-off may be limited, which could have a negative impact on our results\nof operations.\nVarious regulatory agencies and legislatures are also considering regulations and legislation covering identity theft, account management guidelines, credit bureau\nreporting, disclosure rules, security and marketing that would impact us directly, in part due to increased scrutiny of our underwriting and account management\nstandards. These new requirements may restrict our ability to issue charge and credit cards or partner with other financial institutions, which could adversely affect\nour revenue growth.\nSee “Supervision and Regulation” for more information about certain laws and regulations to which we are subject and their impact on us.\nLitigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments and/or requirements resulting in significantly increased expenses,\ndamage to our reputation and/or a material adverse effect on our business.\nBusinesses in the financial services and payments industries have historically been subject to significant legal actions, including class action lawsuits. Many of\nthese actions have included claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages. While we have historically relied on our arbitration clause in agreements\nwith customers to limit our exposure to class action litigation, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in\nthe future. The continued focus of merchants on issues relating to the acceptance of various forms of payment may lead to additional litigation and other legal\nactions. Given the inherent uncertainties involved in litigation, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some matters asserted against us, there is\nsignificant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from litigation matters.\nWe have been subject to regulatory actions by the CFPB and other regulators and may continue to be subject to such actions, including governmental inquiries,\ninvestigations and enforcement proceedings, in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations. Regulatory action could subject us\nto significant fines, penalties or other requirements resulting in Card Member reimbursements, increased expenses, limitations or conditions on our business\nactivities, and damage to our reputation and our brand, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We expect that regulators\nwill continue taking formal enforcement actions against financial institutions in addition to addressing supervisory concerns through non-public supervisory\nactions or findings, which could involve restrictions on our activities, among other limitations that could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity rules, and if we fail to meet these rules, our business would be adversely affected.\nFailure to meet current or future capital or liquidity requirements, including those imposed by the Capital Rules, the LCR, the NSFR or by regulators in\nimplementing other portions of the Basel III framework and the enhanced supervision requirements of Dodd-Frank, could compromise our competitive position\nand could result in restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve, including limiting our ability to pay dividends, repurchase our capital stock, invest in our business,\nexpand our business or engage in acquisitions.\nSome elements of the capital and liquidity regimes are not yet final and certain developments could significantly impact the requirements applicable to financial\ninstitutions. For example, the Basel Committee finalized revisions to the standardized approach for credit risk and operational risk capital requirements. If these\nrevisions are adopted in the United States, we could be required to hold significantly more capital. As a result, the ultimate impact on our long-term capital and\nliquidity planning and our results of operations is not certain, although an increase in our capital and liquid asset levels could lower our return on equity. As part of\nour required stress testing, both internally and by the Federal Reserve, we must continue to comply with applicable capital standards as calculated under the\nstandardized approach in the adverse and severely adverse economic scenarios published by the Federal Reserve each year. To satisfy these requirements, it may\nbe necessary for us to hold additional capital in excess of that required by the Capital Rules . Compliance with capital adequacy and liquidity rules, including the Capital Rules and the LCR, requires a material investment of resources. An inability to meet\nregulatory expectations regarding our compliance with applicable capital adequacy and liquidity rules may also negatively impact the assessment of the Company\nand our U.S. bank subsidiaries by federal banking regulators.\n25\nTable of Contents\nWe continue to progress through the parallel run phase of Basel III advanced approaches implementation. Depending on how the advanced approaches are\nultimately implemented for our asset types, our capital ratios calculated under the advanced approaches may be lower than under the standardized approach. In\nsuch a case, we may need to hold significantly more regulatory capital in order to maintain a given capital ratio.\nFor more information on capital adequacy requirements, see “Capital, Leverage and Liquidity Regulation” under “Supervision and Regulation.”\nWe are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our capital stock. Our subsidiaries are also subject to restrictions that limit\ntheir ability to pay dividends to us, which may adversely affect our liquidity.\nWe are limited in our ability to pay dividends and repurchase capital stock by our regulators, who have broad authority to prohibit any action that would be\nconsidered an unsafe or unsound banking practice. For example, we are subject to a requirement to submit capital plans that include, among other things, projected\ndividend payments and repurchases of capital stock to the Federal Reserve for review. As part of the capital planning and stress testing process, our proposed\ncapital actions are assessed against our ability to satisfy applicable capital requirements in the event of a stressed market environment. If the Federal Reserve\nobjects to our capital plan or if we fail to satisfy applicable capital requirements, our ability to undertake capital actions may be restricted.\nIn addition, the Capital Rules include a capital conservation buffer and a countercyclical capital buffer, which is currently set at zero but which could be increased\nby the Federal Reserve in the future. These buffers can be satisfied only with CET1 capital. If our risk-based capital ratios were to fall below the applicable buffer\nlevels, we would be subject to certain restrictions on dividends, stock repurchases and other capital distributions, as well as discretionary bonus payments to\nexecutive officers.\nA failure to increase dividends along with our competitors, or any reduction of, or elimination of, our common stock dividend or share repurchase program would\nlikely adversely affect the market price of our common stock and market perceptions of American Express.\nOur ability to declare or pay dividends on, or to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of our common stock will be prohibited, subject to certain\nexceptions, in the event that we do not declare and pay in full dividends for the last preceding dividend period of our Series B and Series C preferred stock.\nAmerican Express Company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for liquidity, and federal and state laws limit the amount of dividends that our subsidiaries\nmay pay to the parent company. In particular, our U.S. bank subsidiaries are subject to various statutory and regulatory limitations on their declaration and payment\nof dividends. These limitations may hinder our ability to access funds we may need to make payments on our obligations, make dividend payments on outstanding\nAmerican Express Company capital stock or otherwise achieve strategic objectives.\nFor more information on bank holding company and depository institution dividend restrictions, see “Dividends and Other Capital Distributions” under\n“Supervision and Regulation,” as well as “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity—Share Repurchases and Dividends” under “MD&A” and Note 23 to our\n“Consolidated Financial Statements.”\nRegulation in the areas of privacy, data protection, account access and information and cyber security could increase our costs and affect or limit our business\nopportunities and how we collect and/or use personal information.\nAs privacy, data protection and information and cyber security laws, including data localization, authentication and account access laws, are interpreted and\napplied, compliance costs may increase, particularly in the context of ensuring that adequate data protection, data transfer and account access mechanisms are in\nplace. In recent years, there has been increasing regulatory enforcement and litigation activity in the areas of privacy, data protection and information security in\nthe United States and in various countries in which we operate.\nIn addition, state and federal legislators and/or regulators in the United States and other countries in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising\nprivacy, data protection , account access and information and cyber security laws that potentially could have significant impact on our current and planned privacy,\ndata protection, account access and information and cyber security-related practices, our collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer and/or\nemployee information, and some of our current or planned business activities. New legislation or regulation could increase our costs of compliance and business\noperations and could reduce revenues from certain business initiatives. Moreover, the application of existing or new laws to existing technology and practices can\nbe uncertain and may lead to additional compliance risk and cost.\nCompliance with current or future privacy, data protection, account access and information and cyber security laws relating to consumer and/or employee data\ncould result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to fully maximize our closed-loop capability or provide certain products and\nservices, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection, account access and information and\ncyber security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory and/or governmental investigations and/or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions, ongoing\nregulatory monitoring, customer attrition, decreases in the use or acceptance of our cards and damage to our reputation and our brand.\n26\nTable of Contents\nWe may not be able to effectively manage the operational and compliance risks to which we are exposed.\nWe consider operational risk to be the risk of not achieving business objectives due to inadequate or failed processes or information systems, poor data quality,\nhuman error or the external environment (e.g., natural disasters). Operational risk includes, among others, the risk that employee error or intentional misconduct\ncould result in a material financial misstatement, a failure to monitor a third party’s compliance with a service level agreement or regulatory or legal requirements,\nor a failure to adequately monitor and control access to, or use of, data in our systems we grant to third-party service providers. As processes or organizations are\nchanged, or new products and services are introduced, we may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes. Compliance\nrisk arises from the failure to adhere to applicable laws, rules, regulations and internal policies and procedures. Operational and compliance risks can expose us to\nreputational and legal risks as well as fines, civil money penalties or payment of damages and can lead to diminished business opportunities and diminished ability\nto expand key operations.\nIf we are not able to protect our intellectual property, or successfully defend against any infringement or misappropriation assertions brought against us, our\nrevenue and profitability could be negatively affected.\nWe rely on a variety of measures to protect our intellectual property and control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information. These measures may not\nprevent infringement of our intellectual property rights or misappropriation of our proprietary information and a resulting loss of competitive advantage. In\naddition, competitors or other third parties may allege that our systems, processes or technologies infringe on their intellectual property rights. Given the complex,\nrapidly changing and competitive technological and business environments in which we operate, and the potential risks and uncertainties of intellectual propertyrelated litigation, a future assertion of an infringement or misappropriation claim against us could cause us to lose significant revenues, incur significant defense,\nlicense, royalty or technology development expenses, and/or pay significant monetary damages.\nTax legislative initiatives or assessments by governmental authorities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. The laws and regulations related to tax matters are extremely\ncomplex and subject to varying interpretations. Although management believes our positions are reasonable, we are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue\nService in the United States and by tax authorities in all the jurisdictions in which we conduct business operations. We are being challenged in a number of\ncountries regarding our application of value-added taxes (VAT) to certain transactions. While we believe we comply with all applicable VAT and other tax laws,\nrules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, the tax authorities may determine that we owe additional taxes or apply existing laws and regulations more\nbroadly, which could result in a significant increase in liabilities for taxes and interest in excess of accrued liabilities.\nNew tax legislative initiatives may be proposed from time to time, which may impact our effective tax rate and could adversely affect our tax positions or tax\nliabilities. For example, the impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the United States resulted in a $2.6 billion charge in the fourth quarter of 2017, representing\nour current estimate of taxes primarily on the deemed repatriation of certain overseas earnings and the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities. In\naddition, unilateral or multi-jurisdictional actions by various tax authorities, including an increase in tax audit activity, could have an adverse impact on our tax\nliabilities.\nChanges in accounting principles or standards could adversely affect our reported financial results in a particular period, even if there are no underlying\nchanges in the economics of the business.\nWe are subject to changes in and interpretations of financial accounting matters that govern the measurement of our performance, which could change the way we\naccount for certain of our transactions even if we do not change the way in which we transact. A change in accounting guidance can have a significant effect on our\nreported results, may retroactively affect previously reported results and could cause fluctuations in our reported results. For more information on recently issued\naccounting standards, see Note 1 to our “Consolidated Financial Statements.”\n27\nTable of Contents\nCredit, Liquidity and Market Risks\nOur risk management policies and procedures may not be effective.\nOur risk management framework seeks to identify and mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return. We have established policies and procedures\nintended to identify, monitor and manage the types of risk to which we are subject, including credit risk, market risk, asset liability risk, liquidity risk, operational\nrisk, compliance risk, model risk, strategic and business risk and reputational risk. See “Risk Management” under “MD&A” for a discussion of the policies and\nprocedures we use to identify, monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our businesses. Although we have devoted significant resources to develop\nour risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future, these policies and procedures, as well as our risk management\ntechniques, such as our hedging strategies, may not be fully effective. There may also be risks that exist, or develop in the future, that we have not appropriately\nanticipated, identified or mitigated. As regulations and markets in which we operate continue to evolve, our risk management framework may not always keep\nsufficient pace with those changes. If our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks, we could suffer unexpected losses and\ncould be materially adversely affected.\nManagement of our risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical and/or forecasting models. Although we have a governance framework for model\ndevelopment and independent model validation, the modeling methodology could be erroneous or the models could be misused. If our decisions are based on\nincorrect or misused model outputs and reports, we may face adverse consequences, such as financial loss, poor business and strategic decision-making, or damage\nto our reputation. In addition, some decisions our regulators make, including those related to our capital distribution plans, may be adversely impacted if they\nperceive the quality of our models to be insufficient.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage individual or institutional credit risk, or credit trends that can affect spending on card products and the ability of\ncustomers and partners to pay us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to both individual credit risk, principally from consumer and small business Card Member receivables and loans, and institutional credit risk from\nmerchants, GNS partners, GCS clients, loyalty coalition partners and treasury and investment counterparties. Third parties may default on their obligations to us\ndue to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. Country, regional and political risks can contribute to credit risk. Our ability to assess\ncreditworthiness may be impaired if the criteria or models we use to manage our credit risk become less predictive of future losses, which could cause our losses to\nrise and have a negative impact on our results of operations. Rising delinquencies and rising rates of bankruptcy are often precursors of future write-offs and may\nrequire us to increase our reserve for loan losses. We are continuing to experience relatively low delinquency and write-off rates, but expect that these rates will\nincrease over time. Higher write-off rates and the resulting increase in our reserve for loan losses adversely affect our profitability and the performance of our\nsecuritizations, and may increase our cost of funds.\nAlthough we make estimates to provide for credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of loans and receivables, these estimates may not be accurate. In addition, the\ninformation we use in managing our credit risk may be inaccurate or incomplete. Although we regularly review our credit exposure to specific clients and\ncounterparties and to specific industries, countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances\nthat are difficult to foresee or detect, such as fraud. In addition, our ability to manage credit risk may be adversely affected by legal or regulatory changes (such as\nbankruptcy laws and minimum payment regulations). Increased credit risk, whether resulting from underestimating the credit losses inherent in our portfolio of\nloans and receivables, deteriorating economic conditions (particularly in the United States where approximately 74 percent of our revenues are generated),\nincreases in the level of loan balances, changes in our mix of business or otherwise, could require us to increase our provisions for losses and could have a material\nadverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nInterest rate increases could materially adversely affect our earnings.\nIf the rate of interest we pay on our borrowings increases more than the rate of interest we earn on our loans, our net interest yield, and consequently our net\nincome, could fall. Our interest expense was approximately $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market\ninterest rates would have resulted in a decrease to our annual net interest income of approximately $167 million as of December 31, 2017. We expect the rates we\npay on our deposits will increase as benchmark interest rates increase. In addition, interest rate changes may affect customer behavior, such as impacting the loan\nbalances Card Members carry on their credit cards or their ability to make payments as higher interest rates lead to higher payment requirements, further impacting\nour results of operations.\nFor a further discussion of our interest r ate risk, see “Risk Management ― Market Risk Management Process” under “MD&A.”\n28\nTable of Contents\nAdverse financial market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital.\nWe need liquidity to pay merchants, operating and other expenses, interest on debt and dividends on capital stock and to repay maturing liabilities. The principal\nsources of our liquidity are payments from Card Members, cash flows from our investment portfolio, cash and cash equivalents, proceeds from the issuance of\nunsecured medium- and long-term notes and asset securitizations and direct and third-party sourced deposits, securitized borrowings through our secured financing\nfacilities, a committed bank borrowing facility and the Federal Reserve discount window.\nOur ability to obtain financing in the debt capital markets for unsecured term debt and asset securitizations is dependent on market conditions. Disruptions,\nuncertainty or volatility across the financial markets, as well as adverse developments affecting our competitors and the financial industry generally, could\nnegatively impact market liquidity and limit our access to funding required to operate our business. Such market conditions may also limit our ability to replace, in\na timely manner, maturing liabilities, satisfy regulatory capital requirements and access the funding necessary to grow our business. In some circumstances, we\nmay incur an unattractive cost to raise capital, which could decrease profitability and significantly reduce financial flexibility.\nFor a further discussion of our liquidity and funding needs, see “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity ― Funding Programs and Activities” under\n“MD&A.”\nAny reduction in our and our subsidiaries’ credit ratings could increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets and have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRating agencies regularly evaluate us and our subsidiaries, and their ratings of our and our subsidiaries’ long-term and short-term debt and deposits are based on a\nnumber of factors, including financial strength as well as factors not within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally, and\nthe wider state of the economy. Our and our subsidiaries’ ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any of the rating agencies, which\ncould, among other things, adversely limit our access to the capital markets and adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we and our subsidiaries are\nable to obtain funding.\nAdverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease earnings we receive from our international operations and impact our capital.\nDuring 2017, approximately 26 percent of our total revenues net of interest expense were generated from activities outside the United States. We are exposed to\nforeign exchange risk from our international operations, and accordingly the revenue we generate outside the United States is subject to unpredictable fluctuations\nif the values of other currencies change relative to the U.S. dollar, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nForeign exchange regulations or capital controls might restrict or prohibit the conversion of other currencies into U.S. dollars or our ability to transfer them.\nPolitical and economic conditions in other countries could also impact the availability of foreign exchange for the payment by the local card issuer of obligations\narising out of local Card Members’ spending outside such country and for the payment of card bills by Card Members who are billed in a currency other than their\nlocal currency. Substantial and sudden devaluation of local Card Members’ currency can also affect their ability to make payments to the local issuer of the card in\nconnection with spending outside the local country. The occurrence of any of these circumstances could further impact our results of operations.\nContinuing concerns regarding the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political\ncircumstances in individual Eurozone countries may cause the value of the euro to fluctuate more widely than in the past and could lead to the reintroduction of\nindividual currencies in one or more Eurozone countries, or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely. If there is a\nsignificant devaluation of the euro and we are unable to hedge our foreign exchange exposure to the euro, the value of our euro-denominated assets and liabilities\nwould be correspondingly reduced when translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our financial statements. Similarly, the reintroduction of certain individual\ncountry currencies or the complete dissolution of the euro could adversely affect the value of our euro-denominated assets and liabilities. The reintroduction of\nindividual country currencies would require us to reconfigure our billing and other systems to reflect individual country currencies in place of the euro.\nImplementing such changes could be costly and failures in the currency reconfiguration could cause disruptions in our normal business operations. In addition,\nforeign currency derivative instruments to hedge our market exposure to re-introduced currencies may not be immediately available or may not be available on\nterms that are acceptable to us.\nThe potential developments regarding Europe and the euro, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could continue to have an adverse impact on\nconsumer and business behavior in Europe and globally, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n29\nTable of Contents\nAn inability to accept or maintain deposits due to market demand or regulatory constraints could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our\nability to fund our business.\nOur U.S. bank subsidiaries accept deposits from individuals through third-party brokerage networks as well as directly from consumers through American Express\nPersonal Savings, and use the proceeds as a source of funding. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $63.7 billion in total U.S. retail deposits, of\nwhich a significant amount had been raised through third-party brokerage networks. We face strong competition with regard to deposits, and pricing and product\nchanges may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain cost-effective deposit balances. If we are required to offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain\ndeposits, our funding costs will be adversely impacted.\nOur ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates on deposits is also dependent on capital levels of our U.S. bank subsidiaries. The FDIA’s\nbrokered deposit provisions and related FDIC rules in certain circumstances prohibit banks from accepting or renewing brokered deposits and apply other\nrestrictions, such as a cap on interest rates that can be paid. See “Prompt Corrective Action” under “Supervision and Regulation” for additional information.\nWhile Centurion Bank and American Express Bank were considered “well capitalized” as of December 31, 2017 and had no restrictions regarding acceptance of\nbrokered deposits or setting of interest rates, there can be no assurance they will continue to meet this definition. The Capital Rules require bank holding\ncompanies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital, with a greater emphasis on common equity. Additionally, our regulators can adjust\nthe requirements to be “well capitalized” at any time and have authority to place limitations on our deposit businesses, including the interest rates we pay on\ndeposits. An inability to attract or maintain deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business.\nThe value of our assets or liabilities may be adversely impacted by economic, political or market conditions.\nMarket risk includes the loss in value of portfolios and financial instruments due to adverse changes in market variables, which could negatively impact our\nfinancial condition. We held approximately $3.2 billion of investment securities as of December 31, 2017. In the event that actual default rates of these investment\nsecurities were to significantly change from historical patterns due to challenges in the economy or otherwise, it could have a material adverse impact on the value\nof our investment portfolio, potentially resulting in impairment charges. Defaults or economic disruptions, even in countries or territories in which we do not have\nmaterial investment exposure, conduct business or have operations, could adversely affect us.",

      "item1a":"This section highlights specific risks that could affect us and our businesses. You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report\non Form 10-K. Based on the information currently known to us, we believe the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting us. However, the risks and uncertainties we\nface are not limited to those described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.\nIf any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events or if the circumstances described in the risks and uncertainties occur or continue to occur, these events or circumstances could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. These events could also have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities.\nStrategic, Business and Competitive Risks\nDifficult\nconditions\nin\nthe\nbusiness\nand\neconomic\nenvironment,\nas\nwell\nas\npolitical\nconditions\nin\nthe\nUnited\nStates\nand\nelsewhere,\nmay\nmaterially\nadversely\naffect\nour\nbusiness\nand\nresults\nof\noperations.\nOur results of operations are materially affected by economic, market, political and social conditions in the United States and abroad. We offer a broad array of products and services to consumers,\nsmall businesses and commercial clients and thus are very dependent upon the level of consumer and business activity and the demand for payment and financing products. Slow economic growth,\nvolatile or deteriorating economic conditions or shifts in broader consumer and business trends could change customer behaviors, including spending on our cards, the ability and willingness of Card\nMembers to borrow and pay amounts owed to us, and demand for fee-based products and services. Political conditions, prolonged or recurring government shutdowns, regional hostilities, social\nupheaval, fiscal and monetary policies, trade concerns and tariffs could also negatively affect consumer and business spending, including travel patterns and business investment, and demand for\ncredit.\nFactors such as consumer spending and confidence, unemployment rates, business investment, government spending, trade relationships with other countries, interest rates, taxes, energy costs, the\nvolatility and strength of the capital markets, inflation and deflation all affect the economic environment and, ultimately, our profitability. Such factors may also cause our earnings, billings, loan\nbalances, credit metrics and margins to fluctuate and diverge from expectations of analysts and investors, who may have differing assumptions regarding their impact on our business, adversely\naffecting, and/or increasing the volatility of, the trading price of our common shares. 15\nTable of Contents\nTravel and entertainment expenditures, which comprised approximately 25 percent of our U.S. billed business during 2018, for example, are sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending\nlevels and tend to decline during general economic downturns. Likewise, spending by small businesses and corporate clients, which comprised approximately 41 percent of our worldwide billed\nbusiness during 2018, depends in part on the economic environment and a favorable climate for continued business investment and new business formation. Increases in delinquencies and write-off\nrates as a result of increases in bankruptcies, unemployment rates, changes in customer behaviors or otherwise could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The consequences\nof negative circumstances impacting us or the environment generally can be sudden and severe.\nThe\nexit\nof\nthe\nUnited\nKingdom\nfrom\nthe\nEuropean\nUnion\ncould\nadversely\nimpact\nour\nbusiness,\nresults\nof\noperations\nand\nfinancial\ncondition.\nOur business in the United Kingdom and elsewhere may be negatively impacted by the uncertainty regarding the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union (commonly referred to as\nBrexit), including from a deterioration of consumer and business activity in the United Kingdom and other countries and general uncertainty in the overall business environment in which we operate.\nThe exit itself could negatively impact the United Kingdom and other economies, which could adversely affect spending on our cards and the ability and willingness of Card Members to pay amounts\nowed to us. We may also experience increased volatility in the value of the pound sterling, the euro and other European currencies, which could further strengthen the U.S. dollar, adversely impacting\nthe results of operations from our international activities. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations in the United Kingdom and the\nEuropean Union, and we may incur additional costs or need to make operational changes that reduce revenue as we adapt to potentially divergent regulatory frameworks. Any of these effects of\nBrexit, among others, could adversely affect our business and financial results. As of December 31, 2018, the United Kingdom constituted approximately 4 percent of our worldwide billed business\nand the EMEA region as a whole constituted approximately 11 percent. We have made changes to the structure of our business operations in Europe in anticipation of Brexit, although the financial,\ntrade and legal implications of Brexit are still uncertain and may be more severe than expected given that the final terms upon which the United Kingdom will exit the EU are still not known and the\nlack of comparable precedent.\nOur\noperating\nresults\nmay\nsuffer\nbecause\nof\nsubstantial\nand\nincreasingly\nintense\ncompetition\nworldwide\nin\nthe\npayments\nindustry.\nThe payments industry is highly competitive, and we compete with charge, credit and debit card networks, issuers and acquirers, paper-based transactions (e.g., cash and checks), bank transfer models\n(e.g., wire transfers and ACH), as well as evolving and growing alternative, non-traditional payment and financing providers. If we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors,\ndevelop compelling value propositions for our customers and/or effectively grow in areas such as mobile and online payments and emerging technologies, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nWe believe Visa and Mastercard are larger than we are in most countries. As a result, card issuers and acquirers on the Visa and Mastercard networks may be able to benefit from the dominant\nposition, scale, resources, marketing and pricing of those networks. Our business may also be increasingly negatively affected if we are unable to increase merchant acceptance and our cards are not\naccepted at merchants that accept cards on the Visa and Mastercard networks.\nSome of our competitors have developed, or may develop, substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and may offer richer value propositions or a wider range of programs and\nservices than we offer or may use more effective advertising, marketing or cross-selling strategies to acquire and retain more customers, capture a greater share of spending and borrowings, establish\nand develop more attractive cobrand card and other partner programs and maintain greater merchant acceptance than we have. We may not be able to compete effectively against these threats or\nrespond or adapt to changes in consumer spending habits as effectively as our competitors. We expect expenses such as Card Member rewards and Card Member services expenses to continue to\nincrease as we improve our value propositions for Card Members, including in response to increased competition.\nSpending on our cards could continue to be impacted by increasing consumer usage of charge, credit and debit cards issued on other networks, as well as adoption of alternative payment systems. To\nthe extent other payment mechanisms, systems and products continue to successfully expand, our discount revenues and our ability to access transaction data through our integrated network could be\nnegatively impacted. For example, companies that control access to consumer and merchant payment method choices at the point of sale or through digital wallets, commerce-related experiences,\nmobile applications or other technologies could choose not to accept, suppress use of, or degrade the experience of using our products or could restrict our access to our customers and transaction\ndata. Such companies could also require payments from us to participate in such digital wallets, experiences or applications, impacting our profitability on transactions.\nThe competitive value of our closed-loop data may also be diminished as traditional and non-traditional competitors use other, new data sources and technologies to derive similar insights. Certain\nregulations, such as PSD2 in Europe and open banking initiatives in various jurisdictions around the world, could also diminish the value of our closed-loop data or the demand for our products and\nservices by disintermediating existing financial services providers. 16\nTable of Contents\nTo the extent we expand into new business areas and new geographic regions, we may face competitors with more experience and more established relationships with relevant customers, regulators\nand industry participants, which could adversely affect our ability to compete. Laws and business practices that favor local competitors, require card transactions to be routed over domestic networks\nor prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain businesses could limit our growth in international regions. We may face additional compliance and regulatory risks to the extent that we expand into\nnew business areas, and we may need to dedicate more expense, time and resources to comply with regulatory requirements than our competitors, particularly those that are not regulated financial\ninstitutions.\nMany of our competitors are subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes, and some may have lower cost structures and more agile business models and\nsystems. More restrictive laws and regulations that do not apply to all of our competitors can put us at a disadvantage, including prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions, regulating our\nbusiness practices or adversely affecting our cost structure.\nWe\nface\nintense\ncompetition\nfor\npartner\nrelationships,\nwhich\ncould\nresult\nin\na\nloss\nor\nrenegotiation\nof\nthese\narrangements\nthat\ncould\nhave\na\nmaterial\nadverse\nimpact\non\nour\nbusiness\nand\nresults\nof\noperations.\nIn the ordinary course of our business we enter into different types of contractual arrangements with business partners in a variety of industries. For example, we have partnered with Delta Air Lines,\nas well as many others globally, to offer cobranded cards for consumers and small businesses, and through our Membership Rewards program we have partnered with businesses in many industries,\nincluding the airline industry, to offer benefits to Card Member participants. Competition for relationships with key business partners is very intense and there can be no assurance we will be able to\ngrow or maintain these partner relationships or that they will remain as profitable. Establishing and retaining attractive cobrand card partnerships is particularly competitive among card issuers and\nnetworks as these partnerships typically appeal to high-spending loyal customers. All of our cobrand portfolios in the aggregate accounted for approximately 17 percent of our worldwide billed\nbusiness for the year ended December 31, 2018. Card Member loans related to our cobrand portfolios accounted for approximately 36 percent of our worldwide Card Member loans as of December\n31, 2018.\nWe have partnered with Delta Air Lines across many aspects of our business. We issue cards under cobrand arrangements with Delta and the Delta cobrand portfolio, our largest cobrand portfolio,\naccounted for approximately 8 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended December 31, 2018 and approximately 21 percent of worldwide Card Member loans as of December 31,\n2018. The Delta cobrand portfolio generates fee revenue and interest income from Card Members and discount revenue from Delta and other merchants for spending on Delta cobrand cards. Our\nrelationships with, and revenues related to, Delta are significant and extend beyond cobrand accounts. Delta is a key participant in our Membership Rewards program, provides travel-related benefits\nand services, including airport lounge access for certain American Express Card Members, accepts American Express cards as a merchant and is a corporate payments customer.\nCobrand arrangements are entered into for a fixed period, generally ranging from five to eight years, and will terminate in accordance with their terms, including at the end of the fixed period unless\nextended or renewed at the option of the parties, or upon early termination as a result of an event of default or otherwise. We work with our cobrand partners on an ongoing basis to demonstrate the\nvalue we deliver and evolve our relationships for the benefit of both parties. We face the risk that we could lose partner relationships, even after we have invested significant resources in the\nrelationships. We may also choose to not renew certain cobrand relationships. The volume of billed business could decline and Card Member attrition could increase, in each case, significantly as a\nresult of the termination of one or more cobrand partnership relationships. In addition, some of our cobrand arrangements provide that, upon expiration or termination, the cobrand partner may\npurchase or designate a third party to purchase the loans generated with respect to its program, which could result in the loss of the card accounts and a significant decline in our Card Member loans\noutstanding.\nWe regularly seek to extend or renew cobrand arrangements in advance of the end of the contract term and face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us\nor that we may be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us, as competition for such relationships continues to increase. We make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be\nsignificant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and\nretained. The amount we pay to our cobrand partners has increased, particularly in the United States, and may continue to increase as arrangements are renegotiated due to increasingly intense\ncompetition for cobrand partners among card issuers and networks. See \"Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\" under \"MD&A\" for additional information regarding\ncommitments for payments to certain cobrand partners.\nThe loss of exclusivity arrangements with business partners, the loss of the partner relationship altogether (whether by non-renewal at the end of the contract period, such as the end of our relationship\nwith Costco in the United States in 2016, or as the result of a merger, legal or regulatory action or otherwise, such as the withdrawal of American Airlines in 2014 from our Airport Club Access\nprogram for Centurion ® and Platinum Card ® Members) or the renegotiation of existing partnerships with terms that are significantly worse for us could have a material adverse impact on our\nbusiness and results of operations. See \"Our business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial\ncondition\" for information on the uncertainty regarding our cobrand and agent relationships in the EU. In addition, any publicity associated with the loss of any of our key business partners could\nharm our reputation, making it more difficult to attract and retain Card Members and merchants, and could weaken our negotiating position with our remaining and prospective business partners. 17\nTable of Contents\nWe\nface\ncontinued\nintense\ncompetitive\npressure\nthat\nmay\nimpact\nthe\nprices\nwe\ncharge\nmerchants\nthat\naccept\nour\ncards\nfor\npayment\nfor\ngoods\nand\nservices.\nUnlike our competitors in the payments industry that rely on revolving credit balances to drive profits, our business model is more focused on Card Member spending. Discount revenue, which\nrepresents fees generally charged to merchants when Card Members use their cards to purchase goods and services on our network, is primarily driven by billed business volumes and is our largest\nsingle revenue source. In recent years, we experienced some reduction in our average merchant discount rate, including as a result of rate pressure resulting from regulatory changes affecting\ncompetitor pricing in certain international countries. We also face pressure from competitors that have other sources of income or lower costs that can make their pricing more attractive to business\npartners and merchants. Merchants are also able to negotiate incentives and pricing concessions from us as a condition to accepting our cards or being cobrand partners. As merchants consolidate and\nbecome even larger, we may have to increase the amount of incentives and/or concessions we provide to such merchants, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nCompetitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the costs of these incentives. We have also experienced erosion of our average merchant discount rate as we increase\nmerchant acceptance. We may not be successful in significantly expanding merchant acceptance or offsetting rate erosion with volumes at new merchants.\nIn addition, the regulatory environment and differentiated payment models and technologies from non-traditional players in the alternative payments space could pose challenges to our traditional\npayment model and adversely impact our average merchant discount rate. Some merchants continue to invest in their own payment solutions, such as proprietary-branded mobile wallets, using both\ntraditional and new technology platforms. If merchants are able to drive broad consumer adoption and usage, it could adversely impact our average merchant discount rate and billed business\nvolumes.\nA continuing priority of ours is to drive greater and differentiated value to our merchants which, if not successful, could negatively impact our discount revenue and financial results. We may not\nsucceed in maintaining merchant discount rates or offsetting the impact of declining merchant discount rates, which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability, and therefore\nour ability to invest in innovation and in value-added services for merchants and Card Members.\nSurcharging\nor\nsteering\nby\nmerchants\ncould\nmaterially\nadversely\naffect\nour\nbusiness\nand\nresults\nof\noperations.\nIn certain countries, such as Australia and certain Member States in the EU, merchants are expressly permitted by law to surcharge certain card purchases. In jurisdictions allowing surcharging, we\nhave seen merchant surcharging on American Express cards in certain merchant categories, and in some cases, either the surcharge is greater than that applied to Visa and Mastercard cards or Visa\nand Mastercard cards are not surcharged at all (practices that are known as differential surcharging), even though there are many cards issued on competing networks that have an equal or greater cost\nof acceptance for the merchant. In addition, the laws of a number of states in the United States that prohibit surcharging have been overturned in litigation brought by merchant groups.\nWe also encounter merchants that accept our cards, but tell their customers that they prefer to accept another type of payment or otherwise seek to suppress use of our cards. Our Card Members value\nthe ability to use their cards where and when they want to, and we, therefore, take steps to meet our Card Members’ expectations and to protect the American Express brand by prohibiting this form of\ndiscrimination, subject to local legal requirements.\nIf surcharging, steering or other forms of discrimination become widespread, American Express cards and credit and charge cards generally could become less desirable to consumers, which could\nresult in a decrease in cards-in-force and transaction volumes. The impact could vary depending on such factors as the industry or manner in which a surcharge is levied, how Card Members are\nsteered to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale, the size and recurrence of the underlying charges, and whether and to what extent these actions are applied to other forms of\npayment, including whether it varies depending on the type of card, product, network, acquirer or issuer. Discrimination against American Express cards could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations, particularly to the extent it disproportionately impacts our Card Members or our business.\nWe\nmay\nnot\nbe\nsuccessful\nin\nour\nefforts\nto\npromote\ncard\nusage\nthrough\nmarketing\nand\npromotion,\nmerchant\nacceptance\nand\nCard\nMember\nrewards\nand\nservices,\nor\nto\neffectively\ncontrol\nthe\ncosts\nof\nsuch\ninvestments,\nboth\nof\nwhich\nmay\nimpact\nour\nprofitability.\nRevenue growth is dependent on increasing consumer and business spending on our cards, growing loan balances and increasing fee revenue. We have been investing in a number of growth\ninitiatives, including to attract new Card Members, reduce Card Member attrition and capture a greater share of customers’ total spending and borrowings. There can be no assurance that our\ninvestments to acquire Card Members, provide differentiated features and services and increase usage of our cards will continue to be effective. In addition, if we develop new products or offers that\nattract customers looking for short-term incentives rather than incentivize long-term loyalty, Card Member attrition and costs could increase. Increasing spending on our cards also depends on our\ncontinued expansion of merchant acceptance of our cards. If the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows or reverses itself, our business could suffer. Further, expanding our service offerings, adding\ncustomer acquisition channels and forming new partnerships or renewing current partnerships could have higher costs than our current arrangements, and could adversely impact our average discount\nrate or dilute our brand. 18\nTable of Contents\nAnother way we invest in customer value is through our Membership Rewards program, as well as other Card Member benefits. Any significant change in, or failure by management to reasonably\nestimate, actual redemptions of Membership Rewards points and associated redemption costs could adversely affect our profitability. We rely on third parties, such as Amazon and Delta, for certain\nredemption options and may not be able to continue to offer such redemption options in the future, which could diminish the value of the program for our Card Members. In addition, many credit card\nissuers have instituted rewards and cobrand programs and may introduce programs and services that are similar to or more attractive than ours. Our inability to continue to differentiate our products\nand services generally could materially adversely affect us.\nWe may not be able to cost-effectively manage and expand Card Member benefits, including containing the growth of marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services expenses in the\nfuture. If such expenses continue to increase beyond our expectations, we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing payments volume, increasing other areas of revenues such\nas fee-based revenues, or both. We may not succeed in doing so, particularly in the current competitive and regulatory environment.\nOur\nbrand\nand\nreputation\nare\nkey\nassets\nof\nour\nCompany,\nand\nour\nbusiness\nmay\nbe\naffected\nby\nhow\nwe\nare\nperceived\nin\nthe\nmarketplace.\nOur brand and its attributes are key assets, and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brand. Our ability to attract and retain\nconsumer and small business Card Members and corporate clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, data use and protection,\nmanagement, workplace culture, merchant acceptance, financial condition, our response to unexpected events and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters\n— even if related to seemingly isolated incidents and whether or not factually correct—could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential Card Members and\ncorporate clients, which could make it difficult for us to attract new Card Members and customers and maintain existing ones. Negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in\nany number of activities or circumstances, including card practices, regulatory compliance, the use and protection of customer information and conduct by our employees, and from actions taken by\nregulators or others in response thereto. Social media channels can also cause rapid, widespread reputational harm to our brand.\nOur brand and reputation may also be harmed by actions taken by third parties that are outside our control. For example, any shortcoming of or controversy related to a third-party vendor, business\npartner, merchant acquirer or network partner may be attributed by Card Members and merchants to us, thus damaging our reputation and brand value. The lack of acceptance, suppression of card\nusage or surcharging by merchants can also negatively impact perceptions of our brand and our products, lower overall transaction volume and increase the attractiveness of other payment products or\nsystems. Adverse developments with respect to our industry may also, by association, negatively impact our reputation, or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us.\nFurthermore, as a corporation with headquarters and operations located in the United States, a negative perception of the United States arising from its political or other positions could harm the\nperception of our company and our brand. Although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand, negative perceptions or publicity could materially and adversely\naffect our revenues and profitability.\nA\nmajor\ninformation\nor\ncyber\nsecurity\nincident\nor\nan\nincrease\nin\nfraudulent\nactivity\ncould\nlead\nto\nreputational\ndamage\nto\nour\nbrand\nand\nsignificant\nlegal,\nregulatory\nand\nfinancial\nexposure,\nand\ncould\nreduce\nthe\nuse\nand\nacceptance\nof\nour\ncharge\nand\ncredit\ncards.\nWe and third parties process, transmit, store and provide access to account information in connection with our charge and credit cards and other products, and in the normal course of our business, we\ncollect, analyze and retain significant volumes of certain types of personally identifiable and other information pertaining to our customers and employees.\nOur networks and systems are subject to constant attempts to identify and exploit potential vulnerabilities in our operating environment with intent to disrupt our business operations and capture,\ndestroy, manipulate or expose various types of information relating to corporate trade secrets, customer information, including Card Member, travel and loyalty program data, employee information\nand other sensitive business information, including acquisition activity, financial results and intellectual property. There are a number of motivations for cyber threat actors, including criminal\nactivities such as fraud, identity theft and ransom, corporate or nation-state espionage, political agendas, public embarrassment with the intent to cause financial or reputational harm, intent to disrupt\ninformation technology systems, and to expose and exploit potential security and privacy vulnerabilities in corporate systems and websites.\nGlobal financial institutions like us have experienced a significant increase in information and cyber security risk in recent years and will likely continue to be the target of increasingly sophisticated\ncyberattacks, including computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, ransomware, social engineering attacks (including phishing, impersonation and identity takeover attempts), hacking, website\ndefacement, denial-of-service attacks and other attacks and similar disruptions from the misconfiguration or unauthorized use of or access to computer systems. For example, we and other U.S.\nfinancial services providers have been the targets of distributed denial-of-service attacks from sophisticated third parties. 19\nTable of Contents\nWe develop and maintain systems and processes aimed at detecting and preventing information and cyber security incidents and fraudulent activity, which require significant investment, maintenance\nand ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and regulatory requirements change and as efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Despite our efforts, the possibility\nof information and cyber security incidents, malicious social engineering, fraudulent or other malicious activities and human error or malfeasance cannot be eliminated entirely and will evolve as new\ntechnology is deployed. Risks associated with each of these include theft of funds and other monetary loss, the disruption of our operations and the unauthorized disclosure, release, gathering,\nmonitoring, misuse, modification, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary or other information (including account data information), the effects of which could be compounded if not detected\nquickly.\nInformation or cyber security incidents, fraudulent activity and other actual or perceived failures to maintain confidentiality, integrity, privacy and/or security may lead to regulatory investigations and\nintervention (such as mandatory card reissuance), increased litigation (including class action litigation), remediation, fines and response costs, negative assessments of us and our subsidiaries by\nbanking regulators and rating agencies, reputational and financial damage to our brand, and reduced usage and acceptance of our cards, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our\nbusiness. The disclosure of sensitive company information could also undermine our competitive advantage and divert management attention and resources.\nSuccessful cyberattacks, data breaches, disruptions or other incidents related to the actual or perceived failures to maintain confidentiality, integrity, privacy and/or security at other large financial\ninstitutions, large retailers, travel and hospitality companies or other market participants, whether or not we are impacted, could lead to a general loss of customer confidence that could negatively\naffect us, including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or harming the reputation of the financial system in general, which could result in reduced use of our\nproducts and services. Such events could also result in legislation and additional regulatory requirements. Although we have insurance for losses related to cyber risks and attacks and information and\ncyber security and privacy liability, it may not be sufficient to offset the impact of a material loss event.\nThe\nuninterrupted\noperation\nof\nour\ninformation\nsystems\nis\ncritical\nto\nour\nsuccess\nand\na\nsignificant\ndisruption\ncould\nhave\na\nmaterial\nadverse\neffect\non\nour\nbusiness\nand\nresults\nof\noperations.\nOur information technology systems, including our transaction authorization, clearing and settlement systems, and data centers, may experience service disruptions or degradation because of\ntechnology malfunction, sudden increases in customer transaction volume, natural disasters, accidents, power outages, internet outages, telecommunications failures, fraud, denial-of-service and other\ncyberattacks, terrorism, computer viruses, vulnerabilities in hardware or software, physical or electronic break-ins, or similar events. Service disruptions could prevent access to our online services\nand account information, compromise or limit access to company or customer data, and impede transaction processing and financial reporting. Any interruption or degradation could adversely affect\nthe perception of the reliability of our products and services and materially adversely affect our overall business, reputation and results of operations.\nWe\nrely\non\nthird-party\nproviders\nfor\nacquiring\ncustomers,\ntechnology,\nplatforms\nand\nother\nservices\nintegral\nto\nthe\noperations\nof\nour\nbusinesses.\nThese\nthird\nparties\nmay\nact\nin\nways\nthat\ncould\nharm\nour\nbusiness.\nWe rely on third-party service providers, merchants, customer acquisition channels, processors, aggregators, network partners and other third parties for services that are integral to our operations and\nare subject to the risk that activities of such third parties may adversely affect our business. As outsourcing, specialization of functions, third-party digital services and technology innovation within\nthe payments industry increase (including with respect to mobile technologies, tokenization, big data and cloud storage solutions), more third parties are involved in processing card transactions and\nhandling our data. For example, we rely on third parties for the timely transmission of accurate information across our global network, card acquisition and provision of services to our customers. If a\nservice provider or other third party ceases to provide the data quality or communications capacity we expect or services upon which we rely, as a result of natural disaster, operational disruptions or\nerrors, terrorism, information or cyber security incidents, or any other reason, the failure could interrupt or compromise the quality of our services to customers or impact our ability to grow our\nbusiness.\nThe confidentiality, integrity, privacy and/or security of data communicated over third-party networks or platforms or held by, or accessible to, third parties, including merchants that accept our cards,\npayment processors, payment intermediaries and our third-party vendors and business partners, could become compromised, which could lead to unauthorized use of our data or fraudulent\ntransactions on our cards, as well as costs associated with responding to such an incident. For example, in March 2018, we were alerted by Expedia that certain customers who used Expedia’s Orbitz\nplatform may have been victims of a cyberattack. The attack involved an Orbitz platform that served as the underlying booking engine for online travel websites, including Amextravel.com and travel\nbooked through Amex Travel Representatives.\nWe are also exposed to the risk that a disruption or other event at a third party affecting one of our service providers or partners could impede their ability to provide to us services or data on which we\nrely to operate our business. Service providers or other third parties could also cease providing data to us if we are unable to negotiate for data use rights or use our data for purposes that do not\nbenefit us, which could diminish the competitive value of our closed loop.\nThe management of multiple vendors increases our operational complexity and decreases our control. A failure to exercise adequate oversight over service providers, including compliance with\nservice level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements, could result in regulatory actions, fines, sanctions or economic and reputational harm to us. In addition, we may not be able to effectively\nmonitor or mitigate operational risks relating to our vendors’ service providers. 20\nTable of Contents\nWe\nhave\nagreements\nwith\nbusiness\npartners\nin\na\nvariety\nof\nindustries,\nincluding\nthe\nairline\nindustry,\nthat\nrepresent\na\nsignificant\nportion\nof\nour\nbusiness.\nWe\nare\nexposed\nto\nrisks\nassociated\nwith\nthese\nindustries,\nincluding\nbankruptcies,\nliquidations,\nrestructurings,\nconsolidations\nand\nalliances\nof\nour\npartners,\nand\nthe\npossible\nobligation\nto\nmake\npayments\nto\nour\npartners.\nWe may be obligated to make or accelerate payments to certain business partners such as cobrand partners upon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as a shortfall in certain performance\nand revenue levels. If we are not able to effectively manage these triggering events, we could unexpectedly have to make payments to these partners, which could have a negative effect on our\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nSimilarly, we are exposed to risk from bankruptcies, liquidations, insolvencies, financial distress, restructurings, consolidations and other similar events that may occur in any industry representing a\nsignificant portion of our billed business, which could negatively impact particular card products and services (and billed business generally) and our financial condition and results of operations. For\nexample, we could be materially impacted if we were obligated to or elected to reimburse Card Members for products and services purchased from merchants that have ceased operations or stopped\naccepting our cards.\nWe are exposed to credit risk in the airline industry to the extent we protect Card Members against non-delivery of goods and services, such as where we have remitted payment to an airline for a\nCard Member purchase of tickets that have not yet been used or “flown.” If we are unable to collect the amount from the airline, we may bear the loss for the amount credited to the Card Member.\nSpending at airline merchants accounted for approximately 8 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nFor additional information relating to the general risks related to the airline industry, see “Risk Management—Institutional Credit Risk—Exposure to the Airline and Travel Industry” under\n“MD&A.”\nIf\nwe\nare\nnot\nable\nto\ninvest\nsuccessfully\nin,\nand\ncompete\nat\nthe\nleading\nedge\nof,\ntechnological\ndevelopments\nacross\nall\nour\nbusinesses,\nour\nrevenue\nand\nprofitability\ncould\nbe\nnegatively\naffected.\nOur industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes. In order to compete in our industry, we need to continue to invest in technology across all areas of our business, including in\ntransaction processing, data management and analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence, customer interactions and communications, alternative payment mechanisms, authentication\ntechnologies and risk management and compliance systems. Incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures and take considerable time, and\nultimately may not be successful. We expect that new technologies in the payments industry will continue to emerge, and these new technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, our existing\ntechnology.\nThe process of developing new products and services, enhancing existing products and services and adapting to technological changes and evolving industry standards is complex, costly and\nuncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly impede our ability to compete effectively. Consumer and\nmerchant adoption is a key competitive factor and our competitors may develop products, platforms or technologies that become more widely adopted than ours. In addition, we may underestimate\nthe time and expense we must invest in new products and services before they generate material revenues, if at all.\nOur ability to develop, acquire or access competitive technologies or business processes on acceptable terms may also be limited by intellectual property rights that third parties, including competitors\nand potential competitors, may assert. In addition, our ability to adopt new technologies may be inhibited by the emergence of industry-wide standards, a changing legislative and regulatory\nenvironment, the need for internal product and engineering expertise, resistance to change from Card Members or merchants, or the complexity of our systems.\nWe\nmay\nnot\nbe\nsuccessful\nin\nrealizing\nthe\nbenefits\nassociated\nwith\nour\nacquisitions,\nstrategic\nalliances,\njoint\nventures\nand\ninvestment\nactivity,\nand\nour\nbusiness\nand\nreputation\ncould\nbe\nnegatively\nimpacted.\nWe have acquired a number of businesses and have made a number of strategic investments, and continue to evaluate potential transactions. These transactions could be material to our financial\ncondition and results of operations. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify and secure future acquisition candidates on terms and conditions that are acceptable to us, or\nsuccessfully complete proposed acquisitions and investments, which could impair our growth. The process of integrating an acquired company, business or technology could create unforeseen\noperating difficulties and expenditures, result in unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally. It may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these\ntransactions, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could adversely affect our business and operating results, including as a result of writedowns of goodwill and other intangible assets. 21\nTable of Contents\nWe may also face risks with other types of strategic transactions, such as the sale to InComm of the operations relating to our prepaid reloadable and gift card business in the United States. The\nreloadable operations have experienced disruptions in the past, impacting the ability of our prepaid customers to load and use their cards. If such operations are interrupted, suspended or terminated in\nthe future, it could further negatively impact our customers’ experience, result in additional costs, litigation and regulatory action, and harm our business and reputation.\nJoint ventures, including our GBT JV, and minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational\nand/or compliance risks associated with the joint venture or minority investment. In addition, we may be dependent on joint venture partners, controlling shareholders or management who may have\nbusiness interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of the joint venture partner, controlling shareholders or management may\nadversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us and otherwise damage our reputation and brand.\nOur\nbusiness\nis\nsubject\nto\nthe\neffects\nof\ngeopolitical\nevents,\nweather,\nnatural\ndisasters\nand\nother\nconditions.\nGeopolitical events, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, floods, health pandemics, information or cyber security incidents (including intrusion into or degradation of systems\nor technology by cyberattackers) and other catastrophic events can have a negative effect on our business. Because of our proximity to the World Trade Center, our headquarters were damaged as a\nresult of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Recent hurricanes and other natural disasters have impacted spending and credit performance in the areas affected. Similar events or other\ndisasters or catastrophic events in the future, and events impacting other sectors of the economy, including the telecommunications and energy sectors, could have a negative effect on our businesses\nand infrastructure, including our technology and systems. Card Members in California, New York, Florida, Texas and Georgia account for a significant portion of U.S. Consumer billed business and\nCard Members loans, and our results of operations could be impacted by events or conditions that disproportionately or specifically affect one or more of those states.\nBecause we derive a portion of our revenues from travel-related spending, our business is sensitive to safety concerns related to travel and tourism, limitations on travel and mobility, and healthrelated risks. In addition, disruptions in air travel and other forms of travel can result in the payment of claims under travel interruption insurance policies we offer and, if such disruptions to travel are\nprolonged, they can materially adversely affect overall travel-related spending.\nIf the conditions described above (or similar ones) result in widespread or lengthy disruptions to travel, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Card Member spending\nmay also be negatively impacted in areas affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events. The impact of such events on the overall economy may also adversely affect our financial condition\nor results of operations.\nOur\nsuccess\nis\ndependent,\nin\npart,\nupon\nour\nexecutive\nofficers\nand\nother\nkey\npersonnel,\nand\nmisconduct\nby\nor\nloss\nof\nkey\npersonnel\ncould\nmaterially\nadversely\naffect\nour\nbusiness.\nOur success depends, in part, on our executive officers and other key personnel. Our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. We rely upon our\nkey personnel not only for business success, but also to lead with integrity. To the extent our leaders behave in a manner that does not comport with our company’s values, the consequences to our\nbrand and reputation could be severe and could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe market for qualified individuals is highly competitive, and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed members of our senior management\nteam or other key personnel. Changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or enforcement of such laws or regulations can also impair our ability to attract and\nretain qualified personnel, or to employ such personnel in the location(s) of our choice. As further described in “Supervision and Regulation—Compensation Practices,” our compensation practices\nare subject to review and oversight by the Federal Reserve and the compensation practices of AENB is subject to review and oversight by the OCC. This regulatory review and oversight could further\naffect our ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key personnel. The loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business.\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks\nOngoing\nlegal\nproceedings\nregarding\nprovisions\nin\nour\nmerchant\ncontracts\ncould\nhave\na\nmaterial\nadverse\neffect\non\nour\nbusiness\nand\nresult\nin\nadditional\nlitigation\nand/or\narbitrations,\nsubstantial\nmonetary\ndamages\nand\ndamage\nto\nour\nreputation\nand\nbrand.\nWe are a defendant in a number of actions, including proposed class actions, filed by merchants that challenge the non-discrimination and honor-all-cards provisions in our card acceptance\nagreements and seek damages. A description of these legal proceedings is contained in “Legal Proceedings.”\n22\nTable of Contents\nIt is possible that the resolution of one or any combination of these merchant claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, require us to change our merchant\nagreements in a way that could expose our cards to increased merchant steering and other forms of discrimination that could impair the Card Member experience, result in additional litigation and/or\narbitrations, impose substantial monetary damages and damage our reputation and brand. Even if we were not required to change our merchant agreements, changes in Visa’s and Mastercard’s\npolicies or practices as a result of legal proceedings, lawsuit settlements or regulatory actions pending against them could result in changes to our business practices and materially and adversely\nimpact our profitability.\nOur\nbusiness\nis\nsubject\nto\ncomprehensive\ngovernment\nregulation\nand\nsupervision,\nwhich\ncould\nadversely\naffect\nour\nresults\nof\noperations\nand\nfinancial\ncondition.\nWe are subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world, which significantly affects our business, and has the potential to restrict the scope of our\nexisting businesses, increase our costs of doing business, limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, require changes to business practices, and affect our relationships with partners,\nmerchants and Card Members. Regulatory oversight and supervision of our businesses are generally designed to protect consumers and enhance financial stability and are not designed to protect our\nsecurity holders.\nNew laws or regulations, enhanced supervision efforts or changes in the enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to our businesses could impact the profitability of our business\nactivities, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities or adopt new technologies, require us to change certain of our business practices or alter our relationships with partners, merchants and\nCard Members, or affect retention of our key personnel. Such changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes and could\nadversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Legislators and regulators around the world are aware of each other’s approaches to the regulation of the payments industry.\nConsequently, a development in one country, state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another. To the extent that different regulatory systems impose overlapping or inconsistent\nrequirements on the conduct of our business, we face complexity and additional costs in our compliance efforts.\nIf we fail to satisfy regulatory requirements or maintain our financial holding company status, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, and we may be restricted in\nour ability to take certain capital actions (such as declaring dividends or repurchasing outstanding shares) or engage in certain activities or acquisitions. Additionally, our banking regulators have wide\ndiscretion in the examination and the enforcement of applicable banking statutes and regulations and may restrict our ability to engage in certain activities or acquisitions or require us to maintain\nmore capital.\nIn recent years, legislators and regulators have focused on the operation of card networks, including interchange fees paid to card issuers in payment networks such as Visa and Mastercard and the\nfees merchants are charged to accept cards. Even where we are not directly regulated, regulation of bankcard fees can significantly negatively impact the discount revenue derived from our business,\nincluding as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees. In some cases, regulations also extend to certain\naspects of our business, such as network and cobrand arrangements or terms of card acceptance for merchants, including terms relating to non-discrimination and honor-all-cards. For example, we\nhave largely exited our network businesses in the EU and Australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions. In addition, there is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other\nprovisions of the EU payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the EU. In a ruling issued on February 7, 2018, the EU Court of Justice confirmed the\nvalidity of the application of the fee caps and other provisions in circumstances where three-party networks issue cards with a cobrand partner or through an agent, although the ruling provided only\nlimited guidance as to when or how the provisions might apply in such circumstances. As a result, there can be no assurance we will be able to maintain our cobrand and agent relationships in their\ncurrent form in the EU.\nWe are subject to certain provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the Patriot Act, with regard to maintaining effective AML programs. Similar AML requirements apply under the laws of\nmost jurisdictions where we operate. Increased regulatory focus in this area could result in additional obligations or restrictions with respect to the types of products and services we may offer to\nconsumers, the countries in which our cards may be used, and the types of customers and merchants who can obtain or accept our cards. Emerging technologies, such as digital currencies, could limit\nour ability to track the movement of funds. Money laundering, terrorist financing and other illicit activities involving our cards could result in enforcement action, and our reputation may suffer due to\nour customers’ association with certain countries, persons or entities or the existence of any such transactions.\nVarious regulatory agencies and legislatures are also considering regulations and legislation covering identity theft, account management guidelines, credit bureau reporting, disclosure rules, security\nand marketing that would impact us directly, in part due to increased scrutiny of our underwriting and account management standards. These new requirements may restrict our ability to issue charge\nand credit cards or partner with other financial institutions, which could adversely affect our revenue growth.\nSee “Supervision and Regulation” for more information about certain laws and regulations to which we are subject and their impact on us. 23\nTable of Contents\nLitigation\nand\nregulatory\nactions\ncould\nsubject\nus\nto\nsignificant\nfines,\npenalties,\njudgments\nand/or\nrequirements\nresulting\nin\nsignificantly\nincreased\nexpenses,\ndamage\nto\nour\nreputation\nand/or\na\nmaterial\nadverse\neffect\non\nour\nbusiness.\nBusinesses in the financial services and payments industries have historically been subject to significant legal actions, including class action lawsuits. Many of these actions have included claims for\nsubstantial compensatory or punitive damages. While we have historically relied on our arbitration clause in agreements with customers to limit our exposure to class action litigation, there can be no\nassurance that we will continue to be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future and claims of the type we previously arbitrated could be subject to the complexities, risks and costs\nassociated with class action cases. The continued focus of merchants on issues relating to the acceptance of various forms of payment may lead to additional litigation and other legal actions. Given\nthe inherent uncertainties involved in litigation, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some matters asserted against us, there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we\nmay incur from litigation matters.\nWe have been subject to regulatory actions and may continue to be subject to such actions, including governmental inquiries, investigations and enforcement proceedings, in the event of\nnoncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations. For example, we have been cooperating with certain governmental authorities that have requested information from, or served\nsubpoenas on, us seeking information relating to a small, specialized part of our business, known as foreign exchange international payments (FXIP), which offers cross-border payments services\nprimarily to small and middle market business customers in five countries, including the United States. In particular, we received investigative subpoenas from both the civil and criminal divisions of\nthe U.S. Department of Justice as well as inquiries from the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the CFPB, the FDIC and others. FXIP accounts for less than one half of one percent of our total revenue net of\ninterest expense and is unrelated to our card businesses. Relatedly, we are conducting a review with an outside law firm of FXIP’s pricing practices. We do not believe this matter will have a material\nadverse impact on our operations or results.\nWe expect that regulators will continue taking formal enforcement actions against financial institutions in addition to addressing supervisory concerns through non-public supervisory actions or\nfindings, which could involve restrictions on our activities, among other limitations that could adversely affect our business. In addition, a violation of law or regulation by another financial institution\nis likely to give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar practices by us. Further, a single event may give rise to numerous and overlapping\ninvestigations and proceedings. Regulatory action could subject us to significant fines, penalties or other requirements resulting in Card Member reimbursements, increased expenses, limitations or\nconditions on our business activities, and damage to our reputation and our brand, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe\nare\nsubject\nto\ncapital\nadequacy\nand\nliquidity\nrules,\nand\nif\nwe\nfail\nto\nmeet\nthese\nrules,\nour\nbusiness\nwould\nbe\nadversely\naffected.\nFailure to meet current or future capital or liquidity requirements could compromise our competitive position and could result in restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve, including limiting our\nability to pay dividends, repurchase our capital stock, invest in our business, expand our business or engage in acquisitions.\nSome elements of the capital and liquidity regimes are not yet final and certain developments could significantly impact the requirements applicable to financial institutions. For example, the Basel\nCommittee finalized revisions to the standardized approach for credit risk and operational risk capital requirements. If these revisions are adopted in the United States, we could be required to hold\nsignificantly more capital. As a result, the ultimate impact on our long-term capital and liquidity planning and our results of operations is not certain, although an increase in our capital and liquid\nasset levels could lower our return on equity. As part of our required stress testing, we must continue to comply with applicable capital standards as calculated under the standardized approach in the\nseverely adverse economic scenario published by the Federal Reserve each year. To satisfy these requirements, it may be necessary for us to hold additional capital in excess of that required by the\nCapital Rules.\nCompliance with capital adequacy and liquidity rules requires a material investment of resources. An inability to meet regulatory expectations regarding our compliance with applicable capital\nadequacy and liquidity rules may also negatively impact the assessment of us and our U.S. bank subsidiary by federal banking regulators.\nWe continue to progress through the parallel run phase of Basel III advanced approaches implementation. To the extent that the advanced approaches requirements apply to us, our capital ratios\ncalculated under the advanced approaches may be lower than under the standardized approach. In such a case, we may need to hold significantly more regulatory capital in order to maintain a given\ncapital ratio.\nFor more information on capital adequacy requirements, see “Stress Testing and Capital Planning” and “Capital, Leverage and Liquidity Regulation” under “Supervision and Regulation.”\n24\nTable of Contents\nWe\nare\nsubject\nto\nrestrictions\nthat\nlimit\nour\nability\nto\npay\ndividends\nand\nrepurchase\nour\ncapital\nstock.\nOur\nsubsidiaries\nare\nalso\nsubject\nto\nrestrictions\nthat\nlimit\ntheir\nability\nto\npay\ndividends\nto\nus,\nwhich\nmay\nadversely\naffect\nour\nliquidity.\nWe are limited in our ability to pay dividends and repurchase capital stock by our regulators, who have broad authority to prohibit any action that would be considered an unsafe or unsound banking\npractice. For example, we are subject to a requirement to submit capital plans that include, among other things, projected dividend payments and repurchases of capital stock to the Federal Reserve for\nreview. As part of the capital planning and stress testing process, our proposed capital actions are assessed against our ability to satisfy applicable capital requirements in the event of a stressed market\nenvironment. If the Federal Reserve objects to our capital plan or if we fail to satisfy applicable capital requirements, our ability to undertake capital actions may be restricted.\nIn addition, the Capital Rules include buffers that can be satisfied only with CET1 capital. If our risk-based capital ratios were to fall below the applicable buffer levels, we would be subject to certain\nrestrictions on dividends, stock repurchases and other capital distributions, as well as discretionary bonus payments to executive officers.\nOur ability to declare or pay dividends on, or to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of our common stock will be prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, in the event that we do not\ndeclare and pay in full dividends for the last preceding dividend period of our Series B and Series C preferred stock.\nAmerican Express Company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for liquidity, and federal and state laws, regulations and supervisory policy limit the amount of dividends that our subsidiaries\nmay pay to the parent company. For example, our U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB, is subject to various statutory and regulatory limitations on its declaration and payment of dividends. These limitations\nmay hinder our ability to access funds we may need to make payments on our obligations, make dividend payments on outstanding American Express Company capital stock or otherwise achieve\nstrategic objectives.\nAny reduction of, or elimination of, our common stock dividend or share repurchase program would likely adversely affect the market price of our common stock and market perceptions of American\nExpress. For more information on bank holding company and depository institution dividend restrictions, see “Dividends and Other Capital Distributions” under “Supervision and Regulation,” as well\nas “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity—Share Repurchases and Dividends” under “MD&A” and Note 23 to our “Consolidated Financial Statements.”\nRegulation\nin\nthe\nareas\nof\nprivacy,\ndata\nprotection,\naccount\naccess\nand\ninformation\nand\ncyber\nsecurity\ncould\nincrease\nour\ncosts\nand\naffect\nor\nlimit\nour\nbusiness\nopportunities\nand\nhow\nwe\ncollect\nand/or\nuse\npersonal\ninformation.\nLegislators and regulators in the United States and other countries in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, data protection and information and cyber security laws,\nincluding data localization, authentication and account access laws. As such laws are interpreted and applied (in some cases, with significant differences or conflicting requirements across\njurisdictions), compliance and technology costs will continue to increase, particularly in the context of ensuring that adequate data protection, data transfer and account access mechanisms are in\nplace.\nCompliance with current or future privacy, data protection, account access and information and cyber security laws could significantly impact our collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding\nof consumer and/or employee information and could restrict our ability to fully maximize our closed-loop capability or provide certain products and services, which could materially and adversely\naffect our profitability.\nOur failure to comply with privacy, data protection, account access and information and cyber security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory and/or governmental investigations and/or\nactions, litigation, fines, sanctions, ongoing regulatory monitoring, customer attrition, decreases in the use or acceptance of our cards and damage to our reputation and our brand. In recent years, there\nhas been increasing regulatory enforcement and litigation activity in the areas of privacy, data protection and information and cyber security in the United States and in various countries in which we\noperate.\nFor more information on regulatory and legislative activity in this area, see “Privacy, Data Protection, Information and Cyber Security” under “Supervision and Regulation.”\nWe\nmay\nnot\nbe\nable\nto\neffectively\nmanage\nthe\noperational,\nconduct\nand\ncompliance\nrisks\nto\nwhich\nwe\nare\nexposed.\nWe consider operational risk to be the risk of not achieving business objectives due to inadequate or failed processes or information systems, poor data quality, human error or the external\nenvironment (e.g., natural disasters). Operational risk includes, among others, the risk that error or misconduct could result in a material financial misstatement, a failure to monitor a third party’s\ncompliance with regulatory or legal requirements, or a failure to adequately monitor and control access to, or use of, data in our systems we grant to third-parties. As processes or organizations are\nchanged, or new products and services are introduced, we may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes. Through human error, fraud or malfeasance,\nconduct risk can result in harm to customers, broader markets and the company and its employees.\nCompliance risk arises from the failure to adhere to applicable laws, rules, regulations and internal policies and procedures. Operational, conduct and compliance risks can expose us to reputational\nand legal risks as well as fines, civil money penalties or payment of damages and can lead to diminished business opportunities and diminished ability to expand key operations. 25\nTable of Contents\nIf\nwe\nare\nnot\nable\nto\nprotect\nour\nintellectual\nproperty,\nor\nsuccessfully\ndefend\nagainst\nany\ninfringement\nor\nmisappropriation\nassertions\nbrought\nagainst\nus,\nour\nrevenue\nand\nprofitability\ncould\nbe\nnegatively\naffected.\nWe rely on a variety of measures to protect our intellectual property and control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information. These measures may not prevent infringement of our\nintellectual property rights or misappropriation of our proprietary information and a resulting loss of competitive advantage. In addition, competitors or other third parties may allege that our systems,\nprocesses or technologies infringe on their intellectual property rights. Given the complex, rapidly changing and competitive technological and business environments in which we operate, and the\npotential risks and uncertainties of intellectual property-related litigation, a future assertion of an infringement or misappropriation claim against us could cause us to lose significant revenues, incur\nsignificant defense, license, royalty or technology development expenses, and/or pay significant monetary damages.\nTax\nlegislative\ninitiatives\nor\nassessments\nby\ngovernmental\nauthorities\ncould\nadversely\naffect\nour\nresults\nof\noperations\nand\nfinancial\ncondition.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. The laws and regulations related to tax matters are extremely complex and subject to varying\ninterpretations. Although management believes our positions are reasonable, we are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service in the United States and by tax authorities in all the jurisdictions\nin which we conduct business operations. We are being challenged in a number of countries regarding our application of value-added taxes (VAT) to certain transactions. While we believe we comply\nwith all applicable VAT and other tax laws, rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, the tax authorities may determine that we owe additional taxes or apply existing laws and regulations\nmore broadly, which could result in a significant increase in liabilities for taxes and interest in excess of accrued liabilities.\nNew tax legislative initiatives may be proposed from time to time, which may impact our effective tax rate and could adversely affect our tax positions or tax liabilities. New guidance or\nmodifications to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act) could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, unilateral or multi-jurisdictional actions by various tax\nauthorities, including an increase in tax audit activity, could have an adverse impact on our tax liabilities.\nChanges\nin\naccounting\nprinciples\nor\nstandards\ncould\nadversely\naffect\nour\nreported\nfinancial\nresults\nin\na\nparticular\nperiod,\neven\nif\nthere\nare\nno\nunderlying\nchanges\nin\nthe\neconomics\nof\nthe\nbusiness.\nWe are subject to changes in and interpretations of financial accounting matters, which could change certain of the assumptions or estimates we previously used in preparing our financial statements,\neven if we do not change the way in which we transact or conduct our business. A change in accounting guidance can have a significant effect on our reported results, may retroactively affect\npreviously reported results and could cause fluctuations in our reported results. For more information on recently issued accounting standards, see Note 1 to our “Consolidated Financial Statements.”\nCredit, Liquidity and Market Risks\nOur\nrisk\nmanagement\npolicies\nand\nprocedures\nmay\nnot\nbe\neffective.\nOur risk management framework seeks to identify and mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return. We have established policies and procedures intended to identify, monitor and manage\nthe types of risk to which we are subject, including credit risk, market risk, asset liability risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, compliance risk, model risk, strategic and business risk and reputational\nrisk. See “Risk Management” under “MD&A” for a discussion of the policies and procedures we use to identify, monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our businesses. Although we\nhave devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future, these policies and procedures, as well as our risk management\ntechniques, such as our hedging strategies, may not be fully effective. There may also be risks that exist, or develop in the future, that we have not appropriately anticipated, identified or mitigated. As\nregulations and markets in which we operate continue to evolve, our risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes. If our risk management framework does not\neffectively identify or mitigate our risks, we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected. 26\nTable of Contents\nManagement of our risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical and/or forecasting models. Although we have a governance framework for model development and independent model\nvalidation, the modeling methodology or key assumptions could be erroneous or the models could be misused. In addition, issues with the quality or effectiveness of our data aggregation and\nvalidation procedures, as well as the quality and integrity of data inputs, could result in ineffective or inaccurate model outputs and reports. For example, models based on historical data sets might not\nbe accurate predictors of future outcomes and their ability to appropriately predict future outcomes may degrade over time. If our decisions are based on incorrect or misused models and assumptions\nor we fail to manage data inputs effectively and to aggregate or analyze data in an accurate and timely manner, we may face adverse consequences, such as financial loss, poor business and strategic\ndecision-making, or damage to our reputation. In addition, some decisions our regulators make, including those related to our capital distribution plans, may be adversely impacted if they perceive the\nquality of our models to be insufficient.\nWe\nmay\nnot\nbe\nable\nto\neffectively\nmanage\nindividual\nor\ninstitutional\ncredit\nrisk,\nor\ncredit\ntrends\nthat\ncan\naffect\nspending\non\ncard\nproducts\nand\nthe\nability\nof\ncustomers\nand\npartners\nto\npay\nus,\nwhich\ncould\nhave\na\nmaterial\nadverse\neffect\non\nour\nresults\nof\noperations\nand\nfinancial\ncondition.\nWe are exposed to both individual credit risk, principally from consumer and small business Card Member receivables and loans, and institutional credit risk from corporate Card Member receivables\nand loans, merchants, network partners, loyalty coalition partners and treasury and investment counterparties. Third parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity,\noperational failure or other reasons. General economic factors, such as the rate of inflation, unemployment levels and interest rates, may result in greater delinquencies that lead to greater credit losses.\nCountry, regional and political risks can also contribute to credit risk. A customer’s ability and willingness to repay us can be negatively impacted not only by economic, market, political and social\nconditions but also a customer’s other payment obligations.\nOur ability to assess creditworthiness may be impaired if the criteria or models we use to manage our credit risk prove inaccurate in predicting future losses, which could cause our losses to rise and\nhave a negative impact on our results of operations. Further, our pricing strategies may not offset the negative impact on profitability caused by increases in delinquencies and losses; thus any material\nincreases in delinquencies and losses beyond our current estimates could have a material adverse impact on us.\nRising delinquencies and rising rates of bankruptcy are often precursors of future write-offs and may require us to increase our reserve for loan losses. Higher write-off rates and the resulting increase\nin our reserves for loan and receivable losses adversely affect our profitability and the performance of our securitizations, and may increase our cost of funds.\nAlthough we make estimates to provide for credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of loans and receivables, these estimates may not be accurate. In addition, the information we use in managing our\ncredit risk may be inaccurate or incomplete. Although we regularly review our credit exposure to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries, countries and regions that we believe\nmay present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to foresee or detect, such as fraud. In addition, our ability to manage credit risk may be adversely\naffected by legal or regulatory changes (such as restrictions on collections or changes in bankruptcy laws, minimum payment regulations and re-age guidance). Increased credit risk, whether resulting\nfrom underestimating the credit losses inherent in our portfolio of loans and receivables, deteriorating economic conditions (particularly in the United States where approximately 74 percent of our\nrevenues were generated in 2018), increases in the level of loan balances, changes in our mix of business or otherwise, could require us to increase our provisions for losses and could have a material\nadverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nContinued\ninterest\nrate\nincreases\nand\nchanges\nto\nreference\nrates\ncould\nmaterially\nadversely\naffect\nour\nearnings.\nIf the rate of interest we pay on our borrowings increases more than the rate of interest we earn on our loans, our net interest yield, and consequently our net income, could fall. Our interest expense\nwas approximately $2.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have resulted in a decrease to our annual net interest\nincome of approximately $177 million as of December 31, 2018. We expect the rates we pay on our deposits will increase as benchmark interest rates increase. In addition, interest rate changes may\naffect customer behavior, such as impacting the loan balances Card Members carry on their credit cards or their ability to make payments as higher interest rates lead to higher payment requirements,\nfurther impacting our results of operations.\nAs a result of recent regulatory and other legal proceedings, actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies may result in changes to the manner in which the London interbank offered rate\n(LIBOR) is determined, its discontinuance or the establishment of alternative reference rates. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect that these developments, any discontinuance,\nmodification or other reforms to LIBOR or any other reference rate, the establishment of alternative reference rates, or the impact of any such events on contractual mechanisms may have on the\nmarkets, us or our floating rate debt securities. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuance, modification, alternative reference rates or other reforms may negatively impact market\nliquidity, our access to funding required to operate our business and the trading market for our floating rate debt securities. Furthermore, the use of alternative reference rates or other reforms could\ncause the interest payable on our outstanding floating rate debt securities to be materially different, and potentially higher, than expected.\nFor a further discussion of our interest rate risk, see “Risk Management ― Market Risk Management Process” under “MD&A.”\n27\nTable of Contents\nAdverse\nfinancial\nmarket\nconditions\nmay\nsignificantly\naffect\nour\nability\nto\nmeet\nliquidity\nneeds,\naccess\nto\ncapital\nand\ncost\nof\ncapital.\nWe need liquidity to pay merchants, operating and other expenses, interest on debt and dividends on capital stock and to repay maturing liabilities. The principal sources of our liquidity are payments\nfrom Card Members, proceeds from the issuance of unsecured medium- and long-term notes and asset securitizations and direct and third-party sourced deposits, cash flows from our investment\nportfolio, cash and cash equivalents, securitized borrowings through our secured financing facilities, a committed bank borrowing facility and the Federal Reserve discount window.\nOur ability to obtain financing in the debt capital markets for unsecured term debt and asset securitizations is dependent on market conditions. Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility across the financial\nmarkets, as well as adverse developments affecting our competitors and the financial industry generally, could negatively impact market liquidity and limit our access to funding required to operate\nour business. Such market conditions may also limit our ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities, satisfy regulatory capital requirements and access the funding necessary to grow our\nbusiness. In some circumstances, we may incur an unattractive cost to raise capital, which could decrease profitability and significantly reduce financial flexibility.\nFor a further discussion of our liquidity and funding needs, see “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity ― Funding Programs and Activities” under “MD&A.”\nAny\nreduction\nin\nour\nand\nour\nsubsidiaries’\ncredit\nratings\ncould\nincrease\nthe\ncost\nof\nour\nfunding\nfrom,\nand\nrestrict\nour\naccess\nto,\nthe\ncapital\nmarkets\nand\nhave\na\nmaterial\nadverse\neffect\non\nour\nresults\nof\noperations\nand\nfinancial\ncondition.\nRating agencies regularly evaluate us and our subsidiaries, and their ratings of our and our subsidiaries’ long-term and short-term debt and deposits are based on a number of factors, including\nfinancial strength, as well as factors not within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally, and the wider state of the economy. Our and our subsidiaries’\nratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any of the rating agencies, which could, among other things, adversely limit our access to the capital markets and adversely affect\nthe cost and other terms upon which we and our subsidiaries are able to obtain funding.\nAdverse\ncurrency\nfluctuations\nand\nforeign\nexchange\ncontrols\ncould\ndecrease\nearnings\nwe\nreceive\nfrom\nour\ninternational\noperations\nand\nimpact\nour\ncapital.\nDuring 2018, approximately 26 percent of our total revenues net of interest expense were generated from activities outside the United States. We are exposed to foreign exchange risk from our\ninternational operations, and accordingly the revenue we generate outside the United States is subject to unpredictable fluctuations if the values of other currencies change relative to the U.S. dollar\n(including as a result of Brexit), which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nForeign exchange regulations or capital controls might restrict or prohibit the conversion of other currencies into U.S. dollars or our ability to transfer them. Political and economic conditions in other\ncountries could also impact the availability of foreign exchange for the payment by the local card issuer of obligations arising out of local Card Members’ spending outside such country and for the\npayment by Card Members who are billed in a currency other than their local currency. Substantial and sudden devaluation of local Card Members’ currency can also affect their ability to make\npayments to the local issuer of the card in connection with spending outside the local country. The occurrence of any of these circumstances could further impact our results of operations.\nContinuing concerns regarding the euro may cause the value of the euro to continue to fluctuate and could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more Eurozone countries, or, in\nmore extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely. The reintroduction of certain individual country currencies, a significant devaluation of the euro or the complete\ndissolution of the euro could adversely affect the value of our euro-denominated assets and liabilities.\nPotential developments regarding the euro could also have an adverse impact on consumer and business behavior in Europe and globally, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nAn\ninability\nto\naccept\nor\nmaintain\ndeposits\ndue\nto\nmarket\ndemand\nor\nregulatory\nconstraints\ncould\nmaterially\nadversely\naffect\nour\nliquidity\nposition\nand\nour\nability\nto\nfund\nour\nbusiness.\nOur U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB, accepts deposits directly from consumers through American Express Personal Savings, as well as from individuals through third-party brokerage networks, and uses\nthe proceeds as a source of funding. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $69.1 billion in total U.S. retail deposits, of which a significant amount had been raised through third-party\nbrokerage networks. We face strong competition with regard to deposits, and pricing and product changes may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain cost-effective deposit balances. If we\nare required to offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits, our funding costs will be adversely impacted. 28\nTable of Contents\nOur ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates on deposits is also dependent on AENB’s capital levels. The FDIA’s brokered deposit provisions and related FDIC rules in\ncertain circumstances prohibit banks from accepting or renewing brokered deposits and apply other restrictions, such as a cap on interest rates that can be paid. Additionally, our regulators can adjust\napplicable capital requirements at any time and have authority to place limitations on our deposit businesses. An inability to attract or maintain deposits in the future could materially adversely affect\nour ability to fund our business.\nThe\nvalue\nof\nour\nassets\nor\nliabilities\nmay\nbe\nadversely\nimpacted\nby\neconomic,\npolitical\nor\nmarket\nconditions.\nMarket risk includes the loss in value of portfolios and financial instruments due to adverse changes in market variables, which could negatively impact our financial condition. We held\napproximately $4.7 billion of investment securities as of December 31, 2018. In the event that actual default rates of these investment securities were to significantly change from historical patterns\ndue to economic conditions or otherwise, it could have a material adverse impact on the value of our investment portfolio, potentially resulting in impairment charges. Defaults or economic\ndisruptions, even in countries or territories in which we do not have material investment exposure, conduct business or have operations, could adversely affect us.",

      "item1a":"This section highlights specific risks that could affect us and our businesses, broadly categorized as “Strategic, Business and Competitive Risks,” “Legal,\nRegulatory and Compliance Risks” and “Credit, Liquidity and Market Risks.” You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other\ninformation set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the “Risk Management” section under “MD&A,” which describes our approach to identifying,\nmonitoring and managing the risks we assume in conducting our businesses and provides certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks. Based\non the information currently known to us, we believe the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting us. However, the risks and\nuncertainties we face are not limited to those described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be\nimmaterial may also adversely affect our business.\nIf any of the following risks develop into actual events or if the circumstances described in the risks occur or continue to occur, these events or circumstances could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. These events or circumstances could also have a negative effect on the\ntrading price of our securities.\nStrategic, Business and Competitive Risks\nDifficult conditions in the business and economic environment, as well as political conditions in the United States and elsewhere, may materially adversely\naffect our business and results of operations.\nOur results of operations are materially affected by economic, market, political and social conditions in the United States and abroad. We offer a broad array of\nproducts and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients and thus are very dependent upon the level of consumer and business activity and the\ndemand for payment and financing products. Slow economic growth, volatile or deteriorating economic conditions or shifts in broader consumer and business\ntrends significantly impact customer behaviors, including spending on our cards, the ability and willingness of Card Members to borrow and pay amounts owed to\nus, and demand for fee-based products and services. Political conditions, prolonged or recurring government shutdowns, regional hostilities and the prospect or\noccurrence of more widespread conflicts, social upheaval, fiscal and monetary policies, trade wars and tariffs could also negatively affect consumer and business\nspending, including travel patterns and business investment, and demand for credit.\nFactors such as consumer spending and confidence, unemployment rates, business investment, geopolitical instability, election results, government spending, trade\nrelationships with other countries, interest rates, taxes, energy costs, the volatility and strength of the capital markets, inflation and deflation all affect the economic\nenvironment and, ultimately, our profitability. Such factors may also cause our earnings, billings, loan balances, credit metrics and margins to fluctuate and diverge\nfrom expectations of analysts and investors, who may have differing assumptions regarding their impact on our business, adversely affecting, and/or increasing the\nvolatility of, the trading price of our common shares.\n17\nTable of Contents\nTravel and entertainment expenditures, which comprised approximately 25 percent of our U.S. billed business during 2019, for example, are sensitive to business\nand personal discretionary spending levels and tend to decline during general economic downturns. Likewise, spending by small businesses and corporate clients,\nwhich comprised approximately 41 percent of our worldwide billed business during 2019, depends in part on the economic environment and a favorable climate\nfor continued business investment and new business formation. Increases in delinquencies and write-off rates as a result of increases in bankruptcies,\nunemployment rates, changes in customer behaviors or otherwise could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The consequences of\nnegative circumstances impacting us or the environment generally can be sudden and severe.\nOur business is subject to the effects of geopolitical events, weather, natural disasters and other conditions.\nGeopolitical events, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, floods, health pandemics (including the recent coronavirus outbreak),\ninformation or cyber security incidents (including intrusion into or degradation of systems or technology by cyberattackers) and other catastrophic events can have\na material adverse effect on our business. Because of our proximity to the World Trade Center, our headquarters were damaged as a result of the terrorist attacks of\nSeptember 11, 2001. Recent hurricanes and other natural disasters have impacted spending and credit performance in the areas affected. Similar events or other\ndisasters or catastrophic events in the future, and events impacting other sectors of the economy, including the telecommunications and energy sectors, could have\na negative effect on our businesses and infrastructure, including our technology and systems. Climate change may exacerbate certain of these threats, including the\nfrequency and severity of weather-related events. Card Members in California, New York, Florida, Texas, Georgia and New Jersey account for a significant\nportion of U.S. Consumer billed business and Card Members loans, and our results of operations could be impacted by events or conditions that disproportionately\nor specifically affect one or more of those states.\nBecause we derive a portion of our revenues from travel-related spending, our business is sensitive to safety concerns related to travel and tourism, limitations on\ntravel and mobility, and health-related risks, including travel restrictions and bans as a result of the recent coronavirus outbreak. In addition, disruptions in air\ntravel and other forms of travel can result in the payment of claims under travel interruption insurance policies we offer and, if such disruptions to travel are\nprolonged, they can materially adversely affect overall travel-related spending.\nIf the conditions described above (or similar ones) result in widespread or lengthy disruptions to travel, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations. Card Member spending may also be negatively impacted in areas affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events. The impact of such events\non the overall economy may also adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business in the United Kingdom and elsewhere may be negatively impacted by the exit of the United Kingdom from the EU (commonly referred to as Brexit)\non January 31, 2020, including from a deterioration of the economic environment in the United Kingdom and other countries in which we operate that adversely\naffects spending on our cards and the ability and willingness of Card Members to pay amounts owed to us. We may also experience increased volatility in the value\nof the pound sterling, the euro and other European currencies, which could further strengthen the U.S. dollar, adversely impacting the results of operations from\nour international activities. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations in the United Kingdom and\nthe EU, and we may incur additional costs or need to make operational changes that reduce revenue as we adapt to potentially divergent regulatory frameworks.\nAny of these effects of Brexit, among others, could adversely affect our business and financial results. As of December 31, 2019, the United Kingdom constituted\napproximately 4 percent of our worldwide billed business and the EMEA region as a whole constituted approximately 11 percent. We have made changes to the\nstructure of our business operations in Europe in anticipation of Brexit, although the financial, trade and legal implications of Brexit remain uncertain and may be\nmore severe than expected given the lack of comparable precedent.\nOur operating results may materially suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payments industry.\nThe payments industry is highly competitive, and we compete with card networks, issuers and acquirers, paper-based transactions (e.g., cash and checks), bank\ntransfer models (e.g., wire transfers and ACH), as well as evolving and growing alternative, non-traditional payment and financing providers. If we are not able to\ndifferentiate ourselves from our competitors, develop compelling value propositions for our customers and/or effectively grow in areas such as mobile and online\npayments and emerging technologies, we may not be able to compete effectively.\n18\nTable of Contents\nWe believe Visa and Mastercard are larger than we are in most countries. As a result, card issuers and acquirers on the Visa and Mastercard networks may be able\nto benefit from the dominant position, scale, resources, marketing and pricing of those networks. Our business may also be increasingly negatively affected if we\nare unable to increase or maintain merchant acceptance and our cards are not accepted at merchants that accept cards on the Visa and Mastercard networks.\nSome of our competitors have developed, or may develop, substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and may offer richer value propositions\nor a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective advertising, marketing or cross-selling strategies to acquire and retain more\ncustomers, capture a greater share of spending and borrowings, establish and develop more attractive cobrand card and other partner programs and maintain greater\nmerchant acceptance than we have. We may not be able to compete effectively against these threats or respond or adapt to changes in consumer spending habits as\neffectively as our competitors. Expenses such as Card Member rewards and Card Member services expenses could continue to increase as we improve our value\npropositions for Card Members, including in response to increased competition.\nSpending on our cards could continue to be impacted by increasing consumer usage of charge, credit and debit cards issued on other networks, as well as adoption\nof alternative payment systems. The fragmentation of customer spending to take advantage of different merchant or card incentives or for convenience with\ntechnological solutions may continue to increase. To the extent other payment mechanisms, systems and products continue to successfully expand, our discount\nrevenues and our ability to access transaction data through our integrated payments platform could be negatively impacted. For example, companies that control\naccess to consumer and merchant payment method choices at the point of sale or through digital wallets, commerce-related experiences, mobile applications or\nother technologies could choose not to accept, suppress use of, or degrade the experience of using our products or could restrict our access to our customers and\ntransaction data. Such companies could also require payments from us to participate in such digital wallets, experiences or applications, impacting our profitability\non transactions.\nThe competitive value of our closed-loop data may also be diminished as traditional and non-traditional competitors use other, new data sources and technologies\nto derive similar insights. Certain regulations, such as PSD2 in Europe and open banking initiatives in various jurisdictions around the world, could also diminish\nthe value of our closed-loop data or the demand for our products and services by disintermediating existing financial services providers.\nTo the extent we expand into new business areas and new geographic regions, we may face competitors with more experience and more established relationships\nwith relevant customers, regulators and industry participants, which could adversely affect our ability to compete. Laws and business practices that favor local\ncompetitors, require card transactions to be routed over domestic networks or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain businesses could limit our growth in\ninternational regions. We may face additional compliance and regulatory risks to the extent that we expand into new business areas, and we may need to dedicate\nmore expense, time and resources to comply with regulatory requirements than our competitors, particularly those that are not regulated financial institutions.\nMany of our competitors are subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes, and some may have lower cost structures and\nmore agile business models and systems. More restrictive laws and regulations that do not apply to all of our competitors can put us at a disadvantage, including\nprohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions, regulating our business practices or adversely affecting our cost structure.\nWe face intense competition for partner relationships, which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a material adverse\nimpact on our business and results of operations.\nIn the ordinary course of our business we enter into different types of contractual arrangements with business partners in a variety of industries. For example, we\nhave partnered with Delta, Marriott, British Airways and Hilton, as well as many others globally, to offer cobranded cards for consumers and small businesses, and\nthrough our Membership Rewards program we have partnered with businesses in many industries, including Delta and others in the airline industry, to offer\nbenefits to Card Member participants. See “Business Partners and Relationships” under “Business” for additional information on our business partnerships,\nincluding with Delta.\nCompetition for relationships with key business partners is very intense and there can be no assurance we will be able to grow or maintain these partner\nrelationships or that they will remain as profitable. Establishing and retaining attractive cobrand card partnerships is particularly competitive among card issuers\nand networks as these partnerships typically appeal to high-spending loyal customers. All of our cobrand portfolios in the aggregate accounted for approximately\n18 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended December 31, 2019. Card Member loans related to our cobrand portfolios accounted for\napproximately 38 percent of our worldwide Card Member loans as of December 31, 2019.\n19\nTable of Contents\nCobrand arrangements are entered into for a fixed period, generally ranging from five to ten years, and will terminate in accordance with their terms, including at\nthe end of the fixed period unless extended or renewed at the option of the parties, or upon early termination as a result of an event of default or otherwise. We\nwork with our cobrand partners on an ongoing basis to demonstrate the value we deliver and evolve our relationships for the benefit of both parties. We face the\nrisk that we could lose partner relationships, even after we have invested significant resources in the relationships. We may also choose to not renew certain\ncobrand relationships. The volume of billed business could decline and Card Member attrition could increase, in each case, significantly as a result of the\ntermination of one or more cobrand partnership relationships. In addition, some of our cobrand arrangements provide that, upon expiration or termination, the\ncobrand partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the loans generated with respect to its program, which could result in the loss of the card\naccounts and a significant decline in our Card Member loans outstanding.\nWe regularly seek to extend or renew cobrand arrangements in advance of the end of the contract term and face the risk that existing relationships will be\nrenegotiated with less favorable terms for us or that we may be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us, as competition for such relationships\ncontinues to increase. We make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and\ncorresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. The amount we pay to our\ncobrand partners has increased, particularly in the United States, and may continue to increase as arrangements are renegotiated due to increasingly intense\ncompetition for cobrand partners among card issuers and networks. See \"Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\" under \"MD&A\" for\nadditional information regarding commitments for payments to certain cobrand partners.\nThe loss of exclusivity arrangements with business partners, the loss of the partner relationship altogether (whether by non-renewal at the end of the contract\nperiod, such as the end of our relationship with Costco in the United States in 2016, or as the result of a merger, legal or regulatory action or otherwise, such as the\nwithdrawal of American Airlines in 2014 from our Airport Club Access program for Centurion® and Platinum Card® Members) or the renegotiation of existing\npartnerships with terms that are significantly worse for us could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. See \"Our business is\nsubject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition\" for\ninformation on the uncertainty regarding our cobrand and agent relationships in the EU. In addition, any publicity associated with the loss of any of our key\nbusiness partners could harm our reputation, making it more difficult to attract and retain Card Members and merchants, and could weaken our negotiating position\nwith our remaining and prospective business partners.\nArrangements with our business partners represent a significant portion of our business. We are exposed to risks associated with our business partners,\nincluding reputational issues, business slowdowns, bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings and consolidations, and the possible obligation to make payments\nto our partners.\nOur success is, in many ways, dependent on the success of our business partners. From customer acquisition to cobranding arrangements, from participation in our\nrewards programs to facilitating B2B supplier payments for our corporate clients, we rely on our business partners across many aspects of our company and our\narrangements with business partners represent a significant portion of our business. See “Business Partners and Relationships” under “Business” for additional\ninformation on our business partnerships. To the extent any of our partners fail to effectively promote and support our products, experience a slowdown in their\nbusiness, operational disruptions, reputational issues or loss of consumer confidence, or are otherwise unable to meet our expectations or those of their other\nstakeholders, our business may be materially negatively impacted. In addition, we may be obligated to make or accelerate payments to certain business partners\nsuch as cobrand partners upon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as a shortfall in certain performance and revenue levels. If we are not able to\neffectively manage these triggering events, we could unexpectedly have to make payments to these partners, which could have a negative effect on our financial\ncondition and results of operations. See “Contractual Obligations” under “MD&A” for additional information on financial commitments related to agreements with\ncertain cobrand partners.\nSimilarly, we are exposed to risk from bankruptcies, liquidations, insolvencies, financial distress, restructurings, consolidations and other similar events that may\noccur in any industry representing a significant portion of our billed business, which could negatively impact particular card products and services (and billed\nbusiness generally) and our financial condition and results of operations. We could also be materially impacted if we were obligated or elected to reimburse Card\nMembers for products and services purchased from merchants that have ceased operations or stopped accepting our cards. For example, we are exposed to credit\nrisk in the airline industry to the extent we protect Card Members against non-delivery of goods and services, such as where we have remitted payment to an airline\nfor a Card Member purchase of tickets that have not yet been used or “flown.” If we are unable to collect the amount from the airline, we may bear the loss for the\namount credited to the Card Member. Spending at airline merchants accounted for approximately 8 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019.\nFor additional information relating to the general risks related to the airline industry, see “Risk Management—Institutional Credit Risk—Exposure to the Airline\nand Travel Industry” under “MD&A.”\n20\nTable of Contents\nWe face continued intense competitive pressure that may materially impact the prices we charge merchants that accept our cards for payment for goods and\nservices.\nUnlike our competitors in the payments industry that rely on revolving credit balances to drive profits, our business model is more focused on Card Member\nspending. Discount revenue, which represents fees generally charged to merchants when Card Members use their cards to purchase goods and services on our\nnetwork, is primarily driven by billed business volumes and is our largest single revenue source. Our average merchant discount rate has been impacted by\nregulatory changes affecting competitor pricing in certain international countries. We also face pressure from competitors that have other sources of income or\nlower costs that can make their pricing more attractive to business partners and merchants. Merchants are also able to negotiate incentives and pricing concessions\nfrom us as a condition to accepting our cards or being cobrand partners. As merchants consolidate and become even larger, we may have to increase the amount of\nincentives and/or concessions we provide to such merchants, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Competitive and regulatory\npressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the costs of these incentives. We have also experienced erosion of our average merchant discount rate as we\nincrease merchant acceptance. We may not be successful in significantly expanding merchant acceptance or offsetting rate erosion with volumes at new merchants.\nIn addition, the regulatory environment and differentiated payment models and technologies from non-traditional players in the alternative payments space could\npose challenges to our traditional payment model and adversely impact our average merchant discount rate. Some merchants continue to invest in their own\npayment solutions, such as proprietary-branded mobile wallets, using both traditional and new technology platforms. If merchants are able to drive broad consumer\nadoption and usage, it could adversely impact our average merchant discount rate and billed business volumes.\nA continuing priority of ours is to drive greater and differentiated value to our merchants which, if not successful, could negatively impact our discount revenue\nand financial results. We may not succeed in maintaining merchant discount rates or offsetting the impact of declining merchant discount rates, which could\nmaterially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability, and therefore our ability to invest in innovation and in value-added services for merchants and Card\nMembers.\nSurcharging or steering by merchants could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn certain countries, such as Australia and certain Member States in the EU, merchants are expressly permitted by law to surcharge certain card purchases. In\njurisdictions allowing surcharging, we have seen merchant surcharging on American Express cards in certain merchant categories, and in some cases, either the\nsurcharge is greater than that applied to Visa and Mastercard cards or Visa and Mastercard cards are not surcharged at all (practices that are known as differential\nsurcharging), even though there are many cards issued on competing networks that have an equal or greater cost of acceptance for the merchant. In addition, the\nlaws of a number of states in the United States that prohibit surcharging have been overturned in litigation brought by merchant groups.\nWe also encounter merchants that accept our cards, but tell their customers that they prefer to accept another type of payment or otherwise seek to suppress use of\nour cards. Our Card Members value the ability to use their cards where and when they want to, and we, therefore, take steps to meet our Card Members’\nexpectations and to protect the American Express brand by prohibiting this form of discrimination, subject to local legal requirements.\nIf surcharging, steering or other forms of discrimination become widespread, American Express cards and credit and charge cards generally could become less\ndesirable to consumers, which could result in a decrease in cards-in-force and transaction volumes. The impact could vary depending on such factors as: the\nindustry or manner in which a surcharge is levied; how Card Members are surcharged or steered to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale; the\nease and speed of implementation for merchants, including as a result of new or emerging technologies; the size and recurrence of the underlying charges; and\nwhether and to what extent these actions are applied to other forms of payment, including whether it varies depending on the type of card (e.g., credit or debit),\nproduct, network, acquirer or issuer. Discrimination against American Express cards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations, particularly to the extent it disproportionately impacts our Card Members or our business.\n21\nTable of Contents\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to promote card usage through marketing and promotion, merchant acceptance and Card Member rewards and\nservices, or to effectively control the costs of such investments, both of which may materially impact our profitability.\nRevenue growth is dependent on increasing consumer and business spending on our cards, growing loan balances and increasing fee revenue. We have been\ninvesting in a number of growth initiatives, including to attract new Card Members, reduce Card Member attrition and capture a greater share of customers’ total\nspending and borrowings. There can be no assurance that our investments to acquire Card Members, provide differentiated features and services and increase usage\nof our cards will continue to be effective. In addition, if we develop new products or offers that attract customers looking for short-term incentives rather than\nincentivize long-term loyalty, Card Member attrition and costs could increase. Increasing spending on our cards also depends on our continued expansion of\nmerchant acceptance of our cards. If we are unable to continue growing merchant acceptance or merchants decide to no longer accept American Express cards, our\nbusiness could suffer. Further, expanding our service offerings, adding customer acquisition channels and forming new partnerships or renewing current\npartnerships could have higher costs than our current arrangements, and could adversely impact our average discount rate or dilute our brand.\nAnother way we invest in customer value is through our Membership Rewards program, as well as other Card Member benefits. Any significant change in, or\nfailure by management to reasonably estimate, actual redemptions of Membership Rewards points and associated redemption costs could adversely affect our\nprofitability. We rely on third parties for certain redemption options and may not be able to continue to offer such redemption options in the future, which could\ndiminish the value of the program for our Card Members. Our two largest redemption partners are Amazon and Delta. In addition, many credit card issuers have\ninstituted rewards and cobrand programs and may introduce programs and services that are similar to or more attractive than ours. Our inability to continue to\ndifferentiate our products and services generally could materially adversely affect us.\nWe may not be able to cost-effectively manage and expand Card Member benefits, including containing the growth of marketing, promotion, rewards and Card\nMember services expenses in the future. If such expenses increase beyond our expectations, we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing\npayments volume, increasing other areas of revenues such as fee-based revenues, or both. We may not succeed in doing so, particularly in the current competitive\nand regulatory environment.\nOur brand and reputation are key assets of our Company, and our business may be materially affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace.\nOur brand and its attributes are key assets, and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brand. Our\nability to attract and retain consumer and small business Card Members and corporate clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of\nservice, trustworthiness, business practices, data use and protection, management, workplace culture, merchant acceptance, financial condition, our response to\nunexpected events and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters — even if related to seemingly isolated incidents and\nwhether or not factually correct—could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential Card Members, corporate clients,\nmerchants and partners, which could make it difficult for us to attract new customers and maintain existing ones. Negative public opinion could result from actual\nor alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances, including card practices, regulatory compliance, the use and protection of customer information\nand conduct by our colleagues, and from actions taken by regulators or others in response thereto. Discussion about such matters in social media channels can also\ncause rapid, widespread reputational harm to our brand.\nOur brand and reputation may also be harmed by actions taken by third parties that are outside our control. For example, any shortcoming of or controversy related\nto a third-party vendor, business partner, merchant acquirer or network partner may be attributed by Card Members and merchants to us, thus damaging our\nreputation and brand value. The lack of acceptance, suppression of card usage or surcharging by merchants can also negatively impact perceptions of our brand and\nour products, lower overall transaction volume and increase the attractiveness of other payment products or systems. Adverse developments with respect to our\nindustry may also, by association, negatively impact our reputation, or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us. Furthermore, as a\ncorporation with headquarters and operations located in the United States, a negative perception of the United States arising from its political or other positions\ncould harm the perception of our company and our brand. Although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand, negative\nperceptions or publicity could materially and adversely affect our business volumes, revenues and profitability.\n22\nTable of Contents\nA major information or cyber security incident or an increase in fraudulent activity could lead to reputational damage to our brand and material legal,\nregulatory and financial exposure, and could reduce the use and acceptance of our charge and credit cards.\nWe and third parties process, transmit, store and provide access to account information in connection with our charge and credit cards and other products, and in\nthe normal course of our business, we collect, analyze and retain significant volumes of certain types of personally identifiable and other information pertaining to\nour customers and colleagues.\nOur networks and systems are subject to constant attempts to identify and exploit potential vulnerabilities in our operating environment with intent to disrupt our\nbusiness operations and capture, destroy, manipulate or expose various types of information relating to corporate trade secrets, customer information, including\nCard Member, travel and loyalty program data, colleague information and other sensitive business information, including acquisition activity, non-public financial\nresults and intellectual property. There are a number of motivations for cyber threat actors, including criminal activities such as fraud, identity theft and ransom,\ncorporate or nation-state espionage, political agendas, public embarrassment with the intent to cause financial or reputational harm, intent to disrupt information\ntechnology systems, and to expose and exploit potential security and privacy vulnerabilities in corporate systems and websites.\nGlobal financial institutions like us, as well as our customers, colleagues, regulators, vendors and other third parties, have experienced a significant increase in\ninformation and cyber security risk in recent years and will likely continue to be the target of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, including computer viruses,\nmalicious or destructive code, ransomware, social engineering attacks (including phishing, impersonation and identity takeover attempts), corporate espionage,\nhacking, website defacement, denial-of-service attacks and other attacks and similar disruptions from the misconfiguration or unauthorized use of or access to\ncomputer systems. For example, we and other U.S. financial services providers have been the target of distributed denial-of-service attacks from sophisticated third\nparties. These threats can arise from external parties as well as insiders who knowingly or unknowingly engage in or enable malicious cyber activities.\nWe develop and maintain systems and processes aimed at detecting and preventing information and cyber security incidents and fraudulent activity, which require\nsignificant investment, maintenance and ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and regulatory requirements change and as efforts to overcome security\nmeasures become more sophisticated. Despite our efforts, the possibility of information and cyber security incidents, malicious social engineering, corporate\nespionage, fraudulent or other malicious activities and human error or malfeasance cannot be eliminated entirely and will evolve as new and emerging technology\nis deployed, including the increasing use of personal mobile and computing devices that are outside of our network and control environments. Risks associated\nwith each of these include theft of funds and other monetary loss, the disruption of our operations and the unauthorized disclosure, release, gathering, monitoring,\nmisuse, modification, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary, trade secret or other information (including account data information), the effects of which\ncould be compounded if not detected quickly. Indeed, an information or cyber security incident may not be detected until well after it occurs and the severity and\npotential impact may not be fully known for a substantial period of time after it has been discovered.\nInformation or cyber security incidents, fraudulent activity and other actual or perceived failures to maintain confidentiality, integrity, privacy and/or security has\nled to increased regulatory scrutiny and may lead to regulatory investigations and intervention (such as mandatory card reissuance), increased litigation (including\nclass action litigation), remediation, fines and response costs, negative assessments of us and our subsidiaries by banking regulators and rating agencies,\nreputational and financial damage to our brand, and reduced usage of our products and services, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe disclosure of sensitive company information could also undermine our competitive advantage and divert management attention and resources.\nSuccessful cyberattacks, data breaches, disruptions or other incidents related to the actual or perceived failures to maintain confidentiality, integrity, privacy and/or\nsecurity at other large financial institutions, large retailers, travel and hospitality companies, government agencies or other market participants, whether or not we\nare impacted, could lead to a general loss of customer confidence that could negatively affect us, including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of\nour security measures or harming the reputation of the financial system in general, which could result in reduced use of our products and services. Such events\ncould also result in legislation and additional regulatory requirements. Although we maintain cyber insurance, there can be no assurance that liabilities or losses we\nmay incur will be covered under such policies or that the amount of insurance will be adequate.\n23\nTable of Contents\nThe uninterrupted operation of our information systems is critical to our success and a significant disruption could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness and results of operations.\nOur information technology systems, including our transaction authorization, clearing and settlement systems, and data centers, may experience service disruptions\nor degradation because of technology malfunction, sudden increases in customer transaction volume, natural disasters, accidents, power outages, internet outages,\ntelecommunications failures, fraud, denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, terrorism, computer viruses, vulnerabilities in hardware or software, physical or\nelectronic break-ins, or similar events. Service disruptions or degradations could prevent access to our online services and account information, compromise or\nlimit access to company or customer data, impede transaction processing and financial reporting, and lead to regulatory investigations and fines, increased\nregulatory oversight and litigation. Any such service disruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of the reliability of our products and services\nand materially adversely affect our overall business, reputation and results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party providers for acquiring and servicing customers, technology, platforms and other services integral to the operations of our businesses.\nThese third parties may act in ways that could materially harm our business.\nWe rely on third-party service providers, cobrand partners, merchants, customer acquisition channels, processors, aggregators, network partners and other third\nparties for services that are integral to our operations and are subject to the risk that activities of such third parties may adversely affect our business. As\noutsourcing, specialization of functions, third-party digital services and technology innovation within the payments industry increase (including with respect to\nmobile technologies, tokenization, big data, artificial intelligence and cloud storage solutions), more third parties are involved in processing card transactions and\nhandling our data. For example, we rely on third parties for the timely transmission of accurate information across our global network, card acquisition and\nprovision of services to our customers. If a service provider or other third party ceases to provide the data quality or communications capacity we expect or\nservices upon which we rely, as a result of natural disaster, operational disruptions or errors, terrorism, information or cyber security incidents, or any other reason,\nthe failure could interrupt or compromise the quality of our services to customers or impact our ability to grow our business.\nThe confidentiality, integrity, privacy, availability and/or security of data communicated over third-party networks or platforms or held by, or accessible to, third\nparties, including merchants that accept our cards, payment processors, payment intermediaries and our third-party vendors and business partners, could become\ncompromised, which could lead to unauthorized use of our data or fraudulent transactions on our cards, as well as costs associated with responding to such an\nincident, including regulatory investigations and fines, increased regulatory oversight and litigation. For example, in March 2018, we were alerted by Expedia that\ncertain customers who used Expedia’s Orbitz platform may have been victims of a cyberattack. The attack involved an Orbitz platform that served as the\nunderlying booking engine for online travel websites, including Amextravel.com and travel booked through Amex Travel Representatives.\nWe are also exposed to the risk that a disruption or other event at a third party affecting one of our service providers or partners could impede their ability to\nprovide to us services or data on which we rely to operate our business. Service providers or other third parties could also cease providing data to us or use our data\nin a way that diminishes the competitive value of our closed loop.\nThe management and oversight of multiple vendors increases our operational complexity and governance challenges and decreases our control. A failure to\nexercise adequate oversight over service providers, including compliance with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements, could result in\nregulatory actions, fines, litigation, sanctions or economic and reputational harm to us. In addition, we may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate\noperational risks relating to our vendors’ service providers. We are also exposed to the risk that a service disruption at a common service provider to our vendors\ncould impede their ability to provide services to us. Notwithstanding any attempts to diversify our reliance on third parties, we may not be able to effectively\nmitigate operational risks relating to our vendors’ use of common service providers.\nIf we are not able to invest successfully in, and compete at the leading edge of, technological developments across all our businesses, our revenue and\nprofitability could be materially adversely affected.\nOur industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes. In order to compete in our industry, we need to continue to invest in technology across all\nareas of our business, including in transaction processing, data management and analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence, customer interactions and\ncommunications, open banking and alternative payment mechanisms, authentication technologies and digital identification, tokenization, real-time settlement, and\nrisk management and compliance systems. Incorporating new technologies into our products and services, including developing the appropriate governance and\ncontrols consistent with regulatory expectations, may require substantial expenditures and take considerable time, and ultimately may not be successful. We expect\nthat new technologies in the payments industry will continue to emerge, and these new technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, our existing\ntechnology.\n24\nTable of Contents\nThe process of developing new products and services, enhancing existing products and services and adapting to technological changes and evolving industry\nstandards is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could\nsignificantly impede our ability to compete effectively. Consumer and merchant adoption is a key competitive factor and our competitors may develop products,\nplatforms or technologies that become more widely adopted than ours. In addition, we may underestimate the time and expense we must invest in new products\nand services before they generate significant revenues, if at all.\nOur ability to develop, acquire or access competitive technologies or business processes on acceptable terms may also be limited by intellectual property rights that\nthird parties, including competitors and potential competitors, may assert. In addition, our ability to adopt new technologies may be inhibited by the emergence of\nindustry-wide standards, a changing legislative and regulatory environment, an inability to develop appropriate governance and controls, a lack of internal product\nand engineering expertise, resistance to change from Card Members or merchants, or the complexity of our systems.\nWe may not be successful in realizing the benefits associated with our acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and investment activity, and our business\nand reputation could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have acquired a number of businesses and have made a number of strategic investments, and continue to evaluate potential transactions. These transactions\ncould be material to our financial condition and results of operations. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify and secure future\nacquisition candidates on terms and conditions that are acceptable to us, or successfully complete proposed acquisitions and investments, which could impair our\ngrowth. The process of integrating an acquired company, business or technology could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, result in\nunanticipated liabilities, including legal claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes and information security vulnerabilities or breaches, and harm our business\ngenerally. It may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than\nanticipated or may not be realized at all, which could materially adversely affect our business and operating results, including as a result of write-downs of\ngoodwill and other intangible assets.\nWe may also face risks with other types of strategic transactions, such as the sale to InComm of the operations relating to our prepaid reloadable and gift card\nbusiness. The reloadable operations have experienced disruptions in the past, impacting the ability of our prepaid customers to load and use their cards. If such\noperations are interrupted, suspended or terminated in the future, it could further negatively impact our customers’ experience, result in additional costs, litigation\nand regulatory action, and harm our business and reputation.\nJoint ventures, including our GBT JV and our new joint venture in China, and minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business\noperations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational and/or compliance risks associated with the joint venture or minority investment. In\naddition, we may be dependent on joint venture partners, controlling shareholders or management who may have business interests, strategies or goals that are\ninconsistent with ours. For example, trade secrets and other proprietary information we may provide to a joint venture may become available to third parties\nbeyond our control. The ability to enforce intellectual property and contractual rights to prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information\nmay be limited in certain jurisdictions. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of the joint venture partner, controlling shareholders or management may\nadversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us and otherwise damage our reputation and brand.\nOur success is dependent on maintaining a culture of integrity and respect as well as upon our executive officers and other key personnel, and misconduct by\nor loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe rely upon our key personnel not only for business success, but also to lead with integrity and promote a culture of respect. To the extent our leaders behave in a\nmanner that does not comport with our company’s values, the consequences to our brand and reputation could be severe and could negatively affect our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nThe market for qualified individuals is highly competitive, and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed\nmembers of our senior management team or other key personnel who voluntarily or involuntarily leave the company. Changes in immigration and work permit\nlaws and regulations or the administration or enforcement of such laws or regulations can also impair our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, or to\nemploy such personnel in the location(s) of our choice. As further described in “Supervision and Regulation—Compensation Practices,” our compensation\npractices are subject to review and oversight by the Federal Reserve and the compensation practices of AENB is subject to review and oversight by the OCC. This\nregulatory review and oversight could further affect our ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key personnel. The loss of key personnel could\nmaterially adversely affect our business.\n25\nTable of Contents\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks\nOur business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nWe are subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world, which significantly affects our business and requires\ncontinual enhancement of our compliance efforts. Regulatory oversight and supervision of our businesses are generally designed to protect consumers and enhance\nfinancial stability and are not designed to protect our security holders.\nSupervision efforts and the enforcement of existing laws and regulations impact the scope and profitability of our existing business activities, limit our ability to\npursue certain business opportunities and adopt new technologies, and affect our relationships with Card Members, partners, merchants, vendors and other third\nparties. New laws or regulations could similarly affect our business, increase our costs of doing business and require us to change certain of our business practices\nand invest significant management attention and resources, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Legislators and\nregulators around the world are aware of each other’s approaches to the regulation of the payments industry. Consequently, a development in one country, state or\nregion may influence regulatory approaches in another. To the extent that different regulatory systems impose overlapping or inconsistent requirements on the\nconduct of our business, we face complexity and additional costs in our compliance efforts.\nIf we fail to satisfy regulatory requirements or maintain our financial holding company status, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely\naffected, and we may be restricted in our ability to take certain capital actions (such as declaring dividends or repurchasing outstanding shares) or engage in certain\nbusiness activities or acquisitions. Additionally, our banking regulators have wide discretion in the examination and the enforcement of applicable banking statutes\nand regulations and may restrict our ability to engage in certain business activities or acquisitions or require us to maintain more capital.\nIn recent years, legislators and regulators have focused on the operation of card networks, including interchange fees paid to card issuers in payment networks such\nas Visa and Mastercard and the fees merchants are charged to accept cards. Even where we are not directly regulated, regulation of bankcard fees significantly\nnegatively impacts the discount revenue derived from our business, including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor\npricing in connection with caps on interchange fees. In some cases, regulations also extend to certain aspects of our business, such as network and cobrand\narrangements or the terms of card acceptance for merchants, including terms relating to non-discrimination and honor-all-cards. For example, we have largely\nexited our network businesses in the EU and Australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions. In addition, there is uncertainty as to when or how interchange\nfee caps and other provisions of the EU payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the EU. In a ruling issued on\nFebruary 7, 2018, the EU Court of Justice confirmed the validity of the application of the fee caps and other provisions in circumstances where three-party\nnetworks issue cards with a cobrand partner or through an agent, although the ruling provided only limited guidance as to when or how the provisions might apply\nin such circumstances and remains subject to differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements. As a result, there can be no assurance\nwe will be able to maintain our existing cobrand and agent relationships in the EU. Furthermore, the European Commission is in the process of conducting an\nimpact assessment of the interchange fee caps, which could potentially result in lower and/or additional interchange fee caps and restrictions.\nWe are subject to certain provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the Patriot Act, with regard to maintaining effective AML programs. Similar AML\nrequirements apply under the laws of most jurisdictions where we operate. Increased regulatory focus in this area is likely to result in increased costs related to\noversight, supervision and fines, and may result in changes to our business practices, including restrictions with respect to the types of products and services we\nmay offer to consumers, the countries in which our cards may be used, and the types of customers and merchants who can obtain or accept our cards. Emerging\ntechnologies, such as digital currencies, could limit our ability to track the movement of funds. Money laundering, terrorist financing and other illicit activities\ninvolving our business could result in enforcement action, and our reputation may suffer due to our customers’ association with certain countries, persons or\nentities or the existence of any such transactions.\nVarious regulatory agencies and legislatures are also considering regulations and legislation covering identity theft, account management guidelines, credit bureau\nreporting, disclosure rules, security and marketing that would impact us directly, in part due to increased scrutiny of our underwriting and account management\nstandards. These new requirements may restrict our ability to issue charge and credit cards or partner with other financial institutions, which could adversely affect\nour revenue growth.\nSee “Supervision and Regulation” for more information about certain laws and regulations to which we are subject and their impact on us.\n26\nTable of Contents\nLitigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments and/or requirements resulting in significantly increased expenses,\ndamage to our reputation and/or a material adverse effect on our business.\nBusinesses in the financial services and payments industries have historically been subject to significant legal actions, including class action lawsuits. Many of\nthese actions have included claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages. While we have historically relied on our arbitration clause in agreements\nwith customers to limit our exposure to class action litigation, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in\nthe future and claims of the type we previously arbitrated could be subject to the complexities, risks and costs associated with class action cases. The continued\nfocus of merchants on issues relating to the acceptance of various forms of payment may lead to additional litigation and other legal actions. Given the inherent\nuncertainties involved in litigation, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some matters asserted against us, there is significant uncertainty as to the\nultimate liability we may incur from litigation matters.\nWe have been subject to regulatory actions and may continue to be subject to such actions, including governmental inquiries, investigations and enforcement\nproceedings, in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations. For example, we have been cooperating with certain governmental\nauthorities that have requested information from, or served subpoenas on, us seeking information relating to a small, specialized part of our business, known as\nforeign exchange international payments (FXIP), which offers cross-border payments services primarily to small and middle market business customers in five\ncountries, including the United States. In particular, we received investigative subpoenas from both the civil and criminal divisions of the U.S. Department of\nJustice as well as inquiries from the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the CFPB, the FDIC and others.\nFXIP accounts for less than one half of one percent of our total revenue net of interest expense and is unrelated to our card businesses. Relatedly, our review of\nFXIP’s pricing practices conducted with an outside law firm has concluded and as a result, we voluntarily provided approximately $1.5 million of remediation to\ncertain customers covering a five-year period and took disciplinary action where appropriate. We do not believe this matter will have a material adverse impact on\nour operations or results.\nWe expect that regulators will continue taking formal enforcement actions against financial institutions in addition to addressing supervisory concerns through\nnon-public supervisory actions or findings, which could involve restrictions on our activities, among other limitations that could adversely affect our business. In\naddition, a violation of law or regulation by another financial institution could give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the\nsame or similar practices by us. Further, a single event may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings. Regulatory action could subject\nus to significant fines, penalties or other requirements resulting in Card Member reimbursements, increased expenses, limitations or conditions on our business\nactivities, and damage to our reputation and our brand, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nLegal proceedings regarding provisions in our merchant contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in additional litigation\nand/or arbitrations, substantial monetary damages and damage to our reputation and brand.\nWe are, and have been in the past, a defendant in a number of actions, including legal proceedings and proposed class actions filed by merchants, challenging\ncertain provisions of our card acceptance agreements. A description of the outstanding legal proceedings is contained in “Legal Proceedings.”\nAn adverse outcome in these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, require us to change our merchant\nagreements in a way that could expose our cards to increased merchant steering and other forms of discrimination that could impair the Card Member experience,\nresult in additional litigation and/or arbitrations, impose substantial monetary damages and damage our reputation and brand. Even if we were not required to\nchange our merchant agreements, changes in Visa’s and Mastercard’s policies or practices as a result of legal proceedings, lawsuit settlements or regulatory actions\npending against them could result in changes to our business practices and materially and adversely impact our profitability.\nWe are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity rules, and if we fail to meet these rules, our business would be materially adversely affected.\nFailure to meet current or future capital or liquidity requirements could compromise our competitive position and could result in restrictions imposed by the\nFederal Reserve, including limiting our ability to pay dividends, repurchase our capital stock, invest in our business, expand our business or engage in acquisitions.\n27\nTable of Contents\nSome elements of the capital and liquidity regimes are not yet final and certain developments could significantly impact the requirements applicable to financial\ninstitutions. For example, the Basel Committee finalized revisions to the standardized approach for credit risk and operational risk capital requirements. If these\nrevisions are adopted in the United States, we could be required to hold significantly more capital. As a result, the ultimate impact on our long-term capital and\nliquidity planning and our results of operations is not certain, although an increase in our capital and liquid asset levels could lower our return on equity. As part of\nour required stress testing, we must continue to comply with applicable capital standards as calculated under the standardized approach in the severely adverse\neconomic scenario published by the Federal Reserve. To satisfy these requirements, it may be necessary for us to hold additional capital in excess of that required\nby the Capital Rules.\nCompliance with capital adequacy and liquidity rules requires a material investment of resources. An inability to meet regulatory expectations regarding our\ncompliance with applicable capital adequacy and liquidity rules may also negatively impact the assessment of us and our U.S. bank subsidiary by federal banking\nregulators.\nFor more information on capital adequacy requirements, see “Stress Testing and Capital Planning” and “Capital, Leverage and Liquidity Regulation” under\n“Supervision and Regulation.”\nWe are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our capital stock. Our subsidiaries are also subject to restrictions that limit\ntheir ability to pay dividends to us, which may adversely affect our liquidity.\nWe are limited in our ability to pay dividends and repurchase capital stock by our regulators, who have broad authority to prohibit any action that would be\nconsidered an unsafe or unsound banking practice. For example, we are subject to a requirement to submit capital plans that include, among other things, projected\ndividend payments and repurchases of capital stock to the Federal Reserve for review. As part of the capital planning and stress testing process, our proposed\ncapital actions are assessed against our ability to satisfy applicable capital requirements in the event of a stressed market environment. If the Federal Reserve\nobjects to our capital plan or if we fail to satisfy applicable capital requirements, our ability to undertake capital actions may be restricted.\nIn addition, the Capital Rules include buffers that can be satisfied only with CET1 capital. If our risk-based capital ratios were to fall below the applicable buffer\nlevels, we would be subject to certain restrictions on dividends, stock repurchases and other capital distributions, as well as discretionary bonus payments to\nexecutive officers.\nOur ability to declare or pay dividends on, or to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of our common stock will be prohibited, subject to certain\nexceptions, in the event that we do not declare and pay in full dividends for the last preceding dividend period of our Series B and Series C preferred stock.\nAmerican Express Company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for liquidity, and federal and state laws, regulations and supervisory policy limit the amount\nof dividends that our subsidiaries may pay to the parent company. For example, our U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB, is subject to various statutory and regulatory\nlimitations on its declaration and payment of dividends. These limitations may hinder our ability to access funds we may need to make payments on our\nobligations, make dividend payments on outstanding American Express Company capital stock or otherwise achieve strategic objectives.\nAny reduction of, or elimination of, our common stock dividend or share repurchase program would likely adversely affect the market price of our common stock\nand market perceptions of American Express. For more information on bank holding company and depository institution dividend restrictions, see “Dividends and\nOther Capital Distributions” under “Supervision and Regulation,” as well as “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity—Share Repurchases and Dividends”\nunder “MD&A” and Note 22 to our “Consolidated Financial Statements.”\nRegulation in the areas of privacy, data protection, account access and information and cyber security could increase our costs and affect or limit our business\nopportunities and how we collect and/or use personal information.\nLegislators and regulators in the United States and other countries in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, data protection and\ninformation and cyber security laws, including data localization, authentication and account access laws. As such laws are interpreted and applied (in some cases,\nwith significant differences or conflicting requirements across jurisdictions), compliance and technology costs will continue to increase, particularly in the context\nof ensuring that adequate data protection, data transfer and account access mechanisms are in place.\nCompliance with current or future privacy, data protection, account access and information and cyber security laws could significantly impact our collection, use,\nsharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer and/or colleague information and could restrict our ability to fully maximize our closed-loop capability or provide\ncertain products and services, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability.\n28\nTable of Contents\nOur failure to comply with privacy, data protection, account access and information and cyber security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory and/or\ngovernmental investigations and/or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions, ongoing regulatory monitoring, customer attrition, decreases in the use or acceptance of our\ncards and damage to our reputation and our brand. In recent years, there has been increasing regulatory enforcement and litigation activity in the areas of privacy,\ndata protection and information and cyber security in the United States, the EU and various other countries in which we operate.\nFor more information on regulatory and legislative activity in this area, see “Privacy, Data Protection, Information and Cyber Security” under “Supervision and\nRegulation.”\nWe may not be able to effectively manage the operational, conduct and compliance risks to which we are exposed.\nWe consider operational risk to be the risk of not achieving business objectives due to inadequate or failed processes or information systems, poor data quality,\nhuman error or the external environment (e.g., natural disasters). Operational risk includes, among others, the risk that error or misconduct could result in a\nmaterial financial misstatement, a failure to monitor a third party’s compliance with regulatory or legal requirements, or a failure to adequately monitor and control\naccess to, or use of, data in our systems we grant to third-parties. As processes or organizations are changed, or new products and services are introduced, we may\nnot fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes. Through human error, fraud or malfeasance, conduct risk can result in harm\nto customers, broader markets and the company and its employees.\nCompliance risk arises from the failure to adhere to applicable laws, rules, regulations and internal policies and procedures. Operational, conduct and compliance\nrisks can expose us to reputational and legal risks as well as fines, civil money penalties or payment of damages and can lead to diminished business opportunities\nand diminished ability to expand key operations.\nIf we are not able to protect our intellectual property, or successfully defend against any infringement or misappropriation assertions brought against us, our\nrevenue and profitability could be negatively affected.\nWe rely on a variety of measures to protect our intellectual property and control access to, and distribution of, our trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nThese measures may not prevent infringement of our intellectual property rights or misappropriation of our proprietary information and a resulting loss of\ncompetitive advantage. The ability to enforce intellectual property rights to prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information may be limited\nin certain jurisdictions. In addition, competitors or other third parties may allege that our systems, processes or technologies infringe on their intellectual property\nrights. Given the complex, rapidly changing and competitive technological and business environments in which we operate, and the potential risks and\nuncertainties of intellectual property-related litigation, a future assertion of an infringement or misappropriation claim against us could cause us to lose significant\nrevenues, incur significant defense, license, royalty or technology development expenses, and/or pay significant monetary damages.\nTax legislative initiatives or assessments by governmental authorities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. The laws and regulations related to tax matters are extremely\ncomplex and subject to varying interpretations. Although management believes our positions are reasonable, we are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue\nService in the United States and by tax authorities in all the jurisdictions in which we conduct business operations. We are being challenged in a number of\ncountries regarding our application of value-added taxes (VAT) to certain transactions. While we believe we comply with all applicable VAT and other tax laws,\nrules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, the tax authorities may determine that we owe additional taxes or apply existing laws and regulations more\nbroadly, which could result in a significant increase in liabilities for taxes and interest in excess of accrued liabilities.\nNew tax legislative initiatives may be proposed from time to time, which may impact our effective tax rate and could adversely affect our tax positions or tax\nliabilities. New guidance or modifications to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act) could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition,\nunilateral or multi-jurisdictional actions by various tax authorities, including an increase in tax audit activity, could have an adverse impact on our tax liabilities.\n29\nTable of Contents\nCredit, Liquidity and Market Risks\nOur risk management policies and procedures may not be effective.\nOur risk management framework seeks to identify and mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return. We have established policies and procedures\nintended to identify, monitor and manage the types of risk to which we are subject, including credit risk, market risk, asset liability risk, liquidity risk, operational\nrisk, compliance risk, model risk, strategic and business risk and reputational risk. See “Risk Management” under “MD&A” for a discussion of the policies and\nprocedures we use to identify, monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our businesses. Although we have devoted significant resources to develop\nour risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future, these policies and procedures, as well as our risk management\ntechniques, such as our hedging strategies, may not be fully effective. There may also be risks that exist, or develop in the future, that we have not appropriately\nanticipated, identified or mitigated. As regulations and markets in which we operate continue to evolve, our risk management framework may not always keep\nsufficient pace with those changes. If our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks, we could suffer unexpected losses and\ncould be materially adversely affected.\nManagement of our risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical and/or forecasting models. Although we have a governance framework for model\ndevelopment and independent model validation, the modeling methodology or key assumptions could be erroneous or the models could be misused. In addition,\nissues with the quality or effectiveness of our data aggregation and validation procedures, as well as the quality and integrity of data inputs, could result in\nineffective or inaccurate model outputs and reports. For example, models based on historical data sets might not be accurate predictors of future outcomes and their\nability to appropriately predict future outcomes may degrade over time. Upon the adoption of the new accounting guidance for the recognition of credit losses on\ncertain financial instruments, effective January 1, 2020, we began using a new credit reserve methodology, which requires measurement of expected credit losses\nfor the estimated life of the financial instrument, not only based on historical experience and current conditions, but also by including forecasts incorporating\nforward-looking information. If our business decisions or estimates for credit losses are based on incorrect or misused models and assumptions or we fail to\nmanage data inputs effectively and to aggregate or analyze data in an accurate and timely manner, our results of operations and financial condition may be\nmaterially adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage individual or institutional credit risk, or credit trends that can affect spending on card products and the ability of\ncustomers and partners to pay us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to both individual credit risk, principally from consumer and small business Card Member loans and receivables, and institutional credit risk,\nprincipally from corporate Card Member loans and receivables, merchants, network partners, loyalty coalition partners and treasury and investment counterparties.\nThird parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. General economic factors, such as the\nrate of inflation, unemployment levels and interest rates, may result in greater delinquencies that lead to greater credit losses. Country, regional and political risks\ncan also contribute to credit risk. A customer’s ability and willingness to repay us can be negatively impacted not only by economic, market, political and social\nconditions but by a customer’s other payment obligations, and increasing leverage can result in a higher risk that customers will default or become delinquent in\ntheir obligations to us.\nWe rely principally on the customer’s creditworthiness for repayment of the loan or receivable and therefore have no other recourse for collection. Our ability to\nassess creditworthiness may be impaired if the criteria or models we use to manage our credit risk prove inaccurate in predicting future losses, which could cause\nour losses to rise and have a negative impact on our results of operations. Further, our pricing strategies may not offset the negative impact on profitability caused\nby increases in delinquencies and losses; thus any material increases in delinquencies and losses beyond our current estimates could have a material adverse impact on us. Rising delinquencies and rising rates of bankruptcy are often precursors of future write-offs and may require us to increase our reserve for loan losses. Higher\nwrite-off rates and the resulting increase in our reserves for loan and receivable losses adversely affect our profitability and the performance of our securitizations,\nand may increase our cost of funds.\nAlthough we make estimates to provide for credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of loans and receivables, these estimates may not be accurate. In addition, the\ninformation we use in managing our credit risk may be inaccurate or incomplete. As noted above, we began using a new credit reserve methodology, effective\nJanuary 1, 2020, which differs significantly from our previous approach and alters the estimation process, inputs and assumptions used in estimating expected\ncredit losses for loans and receivables. The new methodology may have a significant effect on our reported results and could cause fluctuations in our reported\nresults, even if there are no underlying changes in the economics of the business. For more information on recently issued accounting standards, see Note 1 to our\n“Consolidated Financial Statements.”\n30\nTable of Contents\nAlthough we regularly review our credit exposure to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries, countries and regions that we believe may present\ncredit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to foresee or detect, such as fraud. In addition, our ability to manage credit\nrisk may be adversely affected by legal or regulatory changes (such as restrictions on collections or changes in bankruptcy laws, minimum payment regulations and\nre-age guidance). Increased credit risk, whether resulting from underestimating the credit losses inherent in our portfolio of loans and receivables, deteriorating\neconomic conditions (particularly in the United States where approximately 75 percent of our revenues were generated in 2019), increases in the level of loan\nbalances, changes in our mix of business or otherwise, could require us to increase our provisions for losses and could have a material adverse effect on our results\nof operations and financial condition.\nInterest rate increases could materially adversely affect our earnings.\nIf the rate of interest we pay on our borrowings increases more than the rate of interest we earn on our loans, our net interest yield, and consequently our net\ninterest income, could fall. Our interest expense was approximately $3.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in\nmarket interest rates would have resulted in a decrease to our annual net interest income of approximately $141 million as of December 31, 2019. We expect the\nrates we pay on our deposits will increase if benchmark interest rates increase. In addition, interest rate changes may affect customer behavior, such as impacting\nthe loan balances Card Members carry on their credit cards or their ability to make payments as higher interest rates lead to higher payment requirements, further\nimpacting our results of operations.\nFor a further discussion of our interest rate risk, see “Risk Management ― Market Risk Management Process” under “MD&A.”\nUncertainty relating to LIBOR and other reference rates and their potential discontinuance may negatively impact our access to funding and the value of our\nfinancial instruments and commercial agreements.\nDue to uncertainty surrounding the suitability and sustainability of the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR), central banks and global regulators have called for\nfinancial market participants to prepare for the discontinuance of LIBOR by the end of 2021 and the establishment of alternative reference rates. At this time, it is\nnot possible to predict the effect that any discontinuance, modification or other reforms to LIBOR or any other reference rate, the establishment of alternative\nreference rates, or the impact of any such events on contractual mechanisms may have on the markets, us, or our financial instruments or commercial agreements\nthat reference LIBOR.\nCertain of our financial instruments and commercial agreements contain provisions to replace LIBOR as the benchmark following the occurrence of specified\ntransition events. Such provisions may not be sufficient to trigger a change in the benchmark at all times when LIBOR is no longer representative of market\ninterest rates, or that these events will align with similar events in the market generally or in other parts of the financial markets, such as the derivatives market.\nAlternative reference rates are calculated using components different from those used in the calculation of LIBOR and may fluctuate differently than, and not be\nrepresentative of, LIBOR. In order to compensate for these differences, certain of our financial instruments and commercial agreements allow for a benchmark\nreplacement adjustment. However, there is no assurance that any benchmark replacement adjustment will be sufficient to produce the economic equivalent of\nLIBOR, either at the benchmark replacement date or over the life of such instruments and agreements.\nUncertainty as to the nature and timing of the potential discontinuance or modification of LIBOR, the replacement of LIBOR with one or more alternative\nreference rates or other reforms may negatively impact market liquidity, our access to funding required to operate our business and the trading market for our\nfinancial instruments. Furthermore, the timing of implementation and use of alternative reference rates and corresponding adjustments or other reforms could be\nsubject to disputes, could cause the interest payable on our outstanding financial instruments and commercial agreements to be materially different than expected\nand may impact the value of our financial instruments and commercial agreements.\nFor a further discussion on LIBOR Transition, see “Risk Management ― LIBOR Transition” under “MD&A.”\nAdverse financial market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital.\nWe need liquidity to pay merchants, operating and other expenses, interest on debt and dividends on capital stock and to repay maturing liabilities. The principal\nsources of our liquidity are payments from Card Members, proceeds from the issuance of unsecured medium- and long-term notes and asset securitizations and\ndirect and third-party sourced deposits, cash flows from our investment portfolio, cash and cash equivalents, securitized borrowings through our secured borrowing\nfacilities, a committed bank credit facility and the Federal Reserve discount window.\nOur ability to obtain financing in the debt capital markets for unsecured term debt and asset securitizations is dependent on market conditions. Disruptions,\nuncertainty or volatility across the financial markets, as well as adverse developments affecting our competitors and the financial industry generally, could\nnegatively impact market liquidity and limit our access to funding required to operate our business. Such market conditions may also limit our ability to replace, in\na timely manner, maturing\n31\nTable of Contents\nliabilities, satisfy regulatory capital requirements and access the funding necessary to grow our business. In some circumstances, we may incur an unattractive cost\nto raise capital, which could decrease profitability and significantly reduce financial flexibility.\nFor a further discussion of our liquidity and funding needs, see “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity ― Funding Programs and Activities” under\n“MD&A.”\nAny reduction in our and our subsidiaries’ credit ratings could increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets and have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRating agencies regularly evaluate us and our subsidiaries, and their ratings of our and our subsidiaries’ long-term and short-term debt and deposits are based on a\nnumber of factors, including financial strength, as well as factors not within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally,\nand the wider state of the economy. Our and our subsidiaries’ ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any of the rating agencies, which\ncould, among other things, adversely limit our access to the capital markets and adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we and our subsidiaries are\nable to obtain funding.\nAdverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease earnings we receive from our international operations and impact our capital.\nDuring 2019, approximately 25 percent of our total revenues net of interest expense were generated from activities outside the United States. We are exposed to\nforeign exchange risk from our international operations, and accordingly the revenue we generate outside the United States is subject to unpredictable fluctuations\nif the values of other currencies change relative to the U.S. dollar (including as a result of Brexit), which could have a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations.\nForeign exchange regulations or capital controls might restrict or prohibit the conversion of other currencies into U.S. dollars or our ability to transfer them.\nPolitical and economic conditions in other countries could also impact the availability of foreign exchange for the payment by the local card issuer of obligations\narising out of local Card Members’ spending outside such country and for the payment by Card Members who are billed in a currency other than their local\ncurrency. Substantial and sudden devaluation of local Card Members’ currency can also affect their ability to make payments to the local issuer of the card in\nconnection with spending outside the local country. The occurrence of any of these circumstances could further impact our results of operations.\nAn inability to accept or maintain deposits due to market demand or regulatory constraints could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our\nability to fund our business.\nOur U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB, accepts deposits directly from consumers through American Express Personal Savings, as well as from individuals through thirdparty brokerage networks, and uses the proceeds as a source of funding. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $72.4 billion in total U.S. retail deposits,\nof which a significant amount had been raised through third-party brokerage networks. We face strong and increasing competition with regard to deposits, and\npricing and product changes may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain cost-effective deposit balances. If we are required to offer higher interest rates to\nattract or maintain deposits, our funding costs will be adversely impacted.\nOur ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates on deposits is also dependent on AENB’s capital levels. The FDIA’s brokered deposit\nprovisions and related FDIC rules in certain circumstances prohibit banks from accepting or renewing brokered deposits and apply other restrictions, such as a cap\non interest rates that can be paid. Additionally, our regulators can adjust applicable capital requirements at any time and have authority to place limitations on our\ndeposit businesses. An inability to attract or maintain deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our ability to fund our business.\nThe value of our investments may be adversely impacted by economic, political or market conditions.\nMarket risk includes the loss in value of portfolios and financial instruments due to adverse changes in market variables, which could negatively impact our\nfinancial condition. We held approximately $8.4 billion of investment securities as of December 31, 2019. In the event that actual default rates of these investment\nsecurities were to significantly change from historical patterns due to economic conditions or otherwise, it could have a material adverse impact on the value of our\ninvestment portfolio, potentially resulting in impairment charges. Defaults or economic disruptions, even in countries or territories in which we do not have\nmaterial investment exposure, conduct business or have operations, could adversely affect us.",

      "item1a":"This section highlights certain risks that could affect us and our businesses, broadly categorized as “Strategic, Business and Competitive Risks,” “Legal,\nRegulatory and Compliance Risks” and “Credit, Liquidity and Market Risks.” You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other\ninformation set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the “Risk Management” section under “MD&A,” which describes our approach to identifying,\nmonitoring and managing the risks we assume in conducting our businesses and provides certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks. The\nrisks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to\nbe immaterial may also adversely affect our business.\nStrategic, Business and Competitive Risks\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures implemented to contain the spread of the virus have had, and are expected to continue to have, a\nmaterial adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is having widespread, rapidly evolving and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies, financial markets and business\npractices. The pandemic and containment measures have contributed to, among other things: • Widespread changes to, and significant reductions in, household and business activity and consumer and business spending, as well as economic\nconcerns and a rise in unemployment. • Adverse impacts on our cobrand and other partners in the travel and airline industries, our GBT JV and on our third-party service providers,\nmerchants, customer acquisition channels, processors, aggregators, network partners and other third parties that we rely on for services that are\nintegral to our operations. • Adverse impacts on the creditworthiness of our customers and other counterparties and their ability to pay amounts owed to us and our ability to\ncollect such amounts and required increases in our reserves for credit losses. • Adverse impacts on industries representing a significant portion of our billed business (including, but not limited to, travel and entertainment (T&E)\nspending). • Adverse impacts on capital and credit market conditions and our deposit base, which may limit our access to funding, increase our cost of capital, and\naffect our ability to meet liquidity needs. • An increased risk of significantly higher Card Member reimbursements for goods or services purchased from merchants that cease operations or are\notherwise unable to ultimately provide those goods or services or, in the case of our business partners, impairments of rewards points we purchased\nfrom those partners. • An increased strain on our risk management policies generally, including, but not limited to, the effectiveness and accuracy of our models, given the\nlack of data inputs and comparable precedent. • An increased risk of impairment, restructuring or other charges, including as a result of impairment of the value of our investments and other assets. • Adverse impacts on our daily business operations and our colleagues’ ability to perform necessary business functions, including as a result of illness,\noffice closures and other limitations, or restrictions on movement. • Increased challenges in growing or retaining our Card Member base and in launching new products or businesses or refreshing existing products in\nline with expectations or the current and changing needs of our customers. • Increased spending on our business continuity efforts, such as technology, service centers and our supply chain, and readiness efforts for returning to\nour offices, which may in turn require that we further cut costs and investments in other areas. • An increased risk of an information or cyber security incident, fraud, a failure to maintain the uninterrupted operation of our information systems or a\nfailure in the effectiveness of our AML and other compliance programs due to, among other things, an increase in remote work.\nThese and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may continue even after the outbreak has subsided and containment measures are lifted, and may exacerbate\nmany of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section. The extent to which our business and results of operations will continue to be adversely affected\nwill depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments that we are not able to predict, including the continued spread and severity of the virus and new\nvariants; the imposition of further containment measures and their ability to control the spread of the virus; the availability, distribution and use of effective\ntreatments and vaccines; the extent and duration of the effect on the economy, unemployment, consumer confidence and consumer and business spending; the\navailability and effectiveness of government stimulus measures; and how quickly and to what extent normal operating conditions and customer behaviors resume,\nsuch as with respect to travel, dining and in-person events.\nDifficult conditions in the business and economic environment, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, have had and are expected to continue to\nhave a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe offer a broad array of products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients and thus are very dependent upon the level of consumer\nand business activity and the demand for payment and financing products. Slow\n23\nTable of Contents\neconomic growth, economic contraction or shifts in broader consumer and business trends significantly impact customer behaviors, including spending on our\ncards, the ability and willingness of Card Members to borrow and pay amounts owed to us, and demand for fee-based products and services. Factors such as\nconsumer spending and confidence, unemployment rates, business investment, geopolitical instability, public policy decisions, government spending, international\ntrade relationships, interest rates, taxes, energy costs, the volatility and strength of the capital markets, inflation and deflation all affect the economic environment\nand, ultimately, our profitability. Such factors may also cause our earnings, billings, loan balances, credit metrics and margins to fluctuate and diverge from\nexpectations of analysts and investors, who may have differing assumptions regarding their impact on our business, adversely affecting, and/or increasing the\nvolatility of, the trading price of our common shares.\nSpending at T&E merchants, for example, is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels and circumstances impacting travel. We experienced\nthe effects of this sensitivity in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, with T&E spending decreasing 61 percent compared to 2019, while non-T&E\nspending decreased 1 percent. Likewise, spending by small businesses and corporate clients, which comprised approximately 40 percent of our worldwide billed\nbusiness during 2020, depends in part on the economic environment and a favorable climate for continued business investment and new business formation, as well\nas on related volumes of business travel. During the pandemic, Card Member billed business decreased 19 percent in 2020 compared to 2019.\nIncreases in delinquencies and write-off rates as a result of increases in bankruptcies, unemployment rates, changes in customer behaviors or otherwise could also\nhave a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We increased our reserves for credit losses significantly in 2020 due to the deterioration of the global\nmacroeconomic outlook.\nThe consequences of negative circumstances impacting us or the environment generally can be sudden and severe, as we experienced from the end of the first\nquarter into the second quarter of 2020 due to the pandemic.\nOur business is subject to the effects of geopolitical events, weather, natural disasters, other catastrophic events and other conditions.\nGeopolitical events, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, health pandemics, information or cyber security incidents (including intrusion\ninto or degradation of systems or technology by cyberattacks) and other catastrophic events can have a material adverse effect on our business. Political and social\nconditions, fiscal and monetary policies, trade wars and tariffs, prolonged or recurring government shutdowns, regional or domestic hostilities and the prospect or\noccurrence of more widespread conflicts could also negatively affect consumer and business spending, including travel patterns and business investment, and\ndemand for credit.\nAs noted above, the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is expected to continue to have, a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nBecause of our proximity to the World Trade Center site, our headquarters were damaged as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Recent\nhurricanes and other natural disasters have impacted spending and credit performance in the areas affected. Other disasters or catastrophic events in the future, and\nthe impact of such events on certain industries or the overall economy, could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and infrastructure,\nincluding our technology and systems. Climate change may exacerbate certain of these threats, including the frequency and severity of weather-related events.\nCard Members in California, New York, Florida, Texas, Georgia and New Jersey account for a significant portion of U.S. Consumer billed business and Card\nMembers loans, and our results of operations could be impacted by events or conditions that disproportionately or specifically affect one or more of those states.\nBecause we derive a portion of our revenues from travel-related spending, our business is sensitive to safety concerns related to travel and tourism, limitations on\ntravel and mobility, and health-related risks, including travel restrictions and bans as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and changes in customer behaviors that\nmay continue even after the outbreak has subsided and containment measures are lifted, such as decisions to delay or forgo business or personal travel. In addition,\ndisruptions in air travel and other forms of travel can result in the payment of claims under travel interruption insurance policies we offer.\nThe exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business in the United Kingdom and elsewhere may be negatively impacted by the exit of the United Kingdom from the EU (commonly referred to as Brexit),\nincluding from a deterioration of the economic environment in the United Kingdom and other countries in which we operate. While a trade deal was agreed to\nbetween the United Kingdom and the EU at the end of 2020, the financial, trade and legal implications of Brexit remain uncertain. As of December 31, 2020, the\nUnited Kingdom constituted approximately 4 percent of our worldwide billed business and the EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) region as a whole\nconstituted approximately 9 percent.\nOur operating results may materially suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payments industry.\n24\nTable of Contents\nThe payments industry is highly competitive, and we compete with card networks, issuers and acquirers, paper-based transactions (e.g., cash and checks), bank\ntransfer models (e.g., wire transfers and ACH), as well as evolving and growing alternative payment and financing providers. If we are not able to differentiate\nourselves from our competitors, develop compelling value propositions for our customers and/or effectively grow in areas such as mobile and online payments and\nemerging technologies, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nWe believe Visa and Mastercard are larger than we are in most countries based on billed business volumes. As a result, card issuers and acquirers on the Visa and\nMastercard networks may be able to benefit from the dominant position, scale, resources, marketing and pricing of those networks. Our business may also be\nnegatively affected if we are unable to continue increasing merchant acceptance (including by merchants that accept cards on the Visa and Mastercard networks)\nand perceptions of coverage, or if our Card Members do not experience welcome acceptance of our cards.\nSome of our competitors have developed, or may develop, substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and may offer richer value propositions\nor a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective advertising, marketing or cross-selling strategies to acquire and retain more\ncustomers, capture a greater share of spending and borrowings, establish and develop more attractive cobrand card and other partner programs and maintain greater\nmerchant acceptance than we have. We may not be able to compete effectively against these threats or respond or adapt to changes in consumer spending habits as\neffectively as our competitors. Costs such as Card Member rewards and Card Member services expenses could continue to increase as we improve our value\npropositions for Card Members, including in response to increased competition.\nSpending on our cards could continue to be impacted by increasing consumer usage of credit and debit cards issued on other networks, as well as adoption of\nalternative payment mechanisms, systems and products. The fragmentation of customer spending to take advantage of different merchant or card incentives or for\nconvenience with technological solutions may continue to increase. Revolving credit balances on our cards could also be impacted by alternative financing\nproviders, such as point-of-sale lenders. To the extent other payment and financing mechanisms, systems and products continue to successfully expand, our\ndiscount revenues earned from Card Member spending and our net interest income earned from Card Member borrowing could be negatively impacted. In\naddition, companies that control access to consumer and merchant payment method choices at the point of sale or through digital wallets, commerce-related\nexperiences, mobile applications or other technologies could choose not to accept, suppress use of, or degrade the experience of using our products or could restrict\nour access to our customers and transaction data. Such companies could also require payments from us to participate in such digital wallets, experiences or\napplications or negotiate incentives or pricing concessions, impacting our profitability on transactions.\nThe competitive value of our closed-loop data may also be diminished as traditional and non-traditional competitors use other, new data sources and technologies\nto derive similar insights. Certain regulations, such as PSD2 in Europe and open banking initiatives in various jurisdictions around the world, could also diminish\nthe value of our closed-loop data or the demand for our products and services by disintermediating existing financial services providers.\nTo the extent we expand into new business areas and new geographic regions, such as mainland China, we will face competitors with more experience and more\nestablished relationships with relevant customers, regulators and industry participants, which could adversely affect our ability to compete. Laws and business\npractices that favor local competitors, require card transactions to be routed over domestic networks or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain businesses\ncould limit our growth in international regions. We may face additional compliance and regulatory risks to the extent that we expand into new business areas, and\nwe may need to dedicate more expense, time and resources to comply with regulatory requirements than our competitors, particularly those that are not regulated\nfinancial institutions.\nMany of our competitors are subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes, and some may have lower cost structures and\nmore agile business models and systems. More restrictive laws and regulations that do not apply to all of our competitors can put us at a disadvantage, including\nprohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions, regulating our business practices or adversely affecting our cost structure.\nWe face intense competition for partner relationships, which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a material adverse\nimpact on our business and results of operations.\nIn the ordinary course of our business we enter into different types of contractual arrangements with business partners in a variety of industries. For example, we\nhave partnered with Delta, Marriott, Hilton and British Airways, as well as many others globally, to offer cobranded cards for consumers and small businesses, and\nthrough our Membership Rewards program we have partnered with businesses in many industries, including Delta and others in the airline industry, to offer\nbenefits to Card Member participants. See “Partners and Relationships” under “Business” for additional information on our business partnerships, including with\nDelta.\nCompetition for relationships with key business partners is very intense and there can be no assurance we will be able to grow or maintain these partner\nrelationships or that they will remain as profitable. Establishing and retaining attractive cobrand card partnerships is particularly competitive among card issuers\nand networks as these partnerships typically appeal to high-spending\n25\nTable of Contents\nloyal customers. All of our cobrand portfolios in the aggregate accounted for approximately 19 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020. Card Member loans related to our cobrand portfolios accounted for approximately 37 percent of our worldwide Card Member loans as of\nDecember 31, 2020.\nCobrand arrangements are entered into for a fixed period, generally ranging from five to ten years, and will terminate in accordance with their terms, including at\nthe end of the fixed period unless extended or renewed at the option of the parties, or upon early termination as a result of an event of default or otherwise. We face\nthe risk that we could lose partner relationships, even after we have invested significant resources in the relationships. We may also choose to not renew certain\ncobrand relationships. The volume of billed business could decline and Card Member attrition could increase, in each case, significantly as a result of the\ntermination of one or more cobrand partnership relationships. In addition, some of our cobrand arrangements provide that, upon expiration or termination, the\ncobrand partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the loans generated with respect to its program, which could result in the loss of the card\naccounts and a significant decline in our Card Member loans outstanding.\nWe regularly seek to extend or renew cobrand arrangements in advance of the end of the contract term and face the risk that existing relationships will be\nrenegotiated with less favorable terms for us or that we may be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us, as competition for such relationships\ncontinues to increase. We make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and\ncorresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. The amount we pay to our\ncobrand partners has increased, particularly in the United States, and may continue to increase as arrangements are renegotiated due to increasingly intense\ncompetition for cobrand partners among card issuers and networks. See \"Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\" under \"MD&A\" for\nadditional information regarding commitments for payments to certain cobrand partners.\nThe loss of exclusivity arrangements with business partners, the loss of the partner relationship altogether (whether by non-renewal at the end of the contract\nperiod, such as the end of our relationship with Costco in the United States in 2016, or as the result of a merger, legal or regulatory action or otherwise, such as the\nwithdrawal of American Airlines in 2014 from our Airport Club Access program for Centurion and Platinum Card Members) or the renegotiation of existing\npartnerships with terms that are significantly worse for us could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. See \"Our business is\nsubject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition\" for\ninformation on the uncertainty regarding our cobrand and agent relationships in the EU. In addition, any publicity associated with the loss of any of our key\nbusiness partners could harm our reputation, making it more difficult to attract and retain Card Members and merchants, and could weaken our negotiating position\nwith our remaining and prospective business partners.\nArrangements with our business partners represent a significant portion of our business. We are exposed to risks associated with our business partners,\nincluding reputational issues, business slowdowns, bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings and consolidations, and the possible obligation to make payments\nto our partners.\nOur success is, in many ways, dependent on the success of our partners. From customer acquisition to cobranding arrangements, from participation in our rewards\nprograms to facilitating B2B supplier payments for our corporate clients, we rely on our business partners across many aspects of our company and our\narrangements with business partners represent a significant portion of our business. Some of our partners manage certain aspects of our customer relationships,\nsuch as our OptBlue partners. To the extent any of our partners fail to effectively promote and support our products, experience a slowdown in their business,\noperational disruptions, reputational issues or loss of consumer confidence, or are otherwise unable to meet our expectations or those of their other stakeholders,\nour business may be materially negatively impacted. We face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us or that we\nmay be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us. In addition, we may be obligated to make or accelerate payments to certain business partners such\nas cobrand partners upon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as a shortfall in certain performance and revenue levels. If we are not able to effectively\nmanage these triggering events, we could unexpectedly have to make payments to these partners, which could have a negative effect on our financial condition and\nresults of operations. See “Contractual Obligations” under “MD&A” for additional information on financial commitments related to agreements with certain\ncobrand partners.\nSimilarly, we are exposed to risk from bankruptcies, liquidations, insolvencies, financial distress, restructurings, consolidations and other similar events that may\noccur in any industry representing a significant portion of our billed business, which could negatively impact particular card products and services (and billed\nbusiness generally) and our financial condition and results of operations. During 2020, we pre-purchased loyalty points from certain of our travel cobrand partners,\nwhich we may use for future promotions, rewards and incentive programs for our customers. To the extent such partners cease operations or the loyalty points are\nno longer desired by our customers, the value of the pre-purchased points may be diminished and may result in an impairment charge. We could also be materially\nimpacted if we were obligated or elected to reimburse Card Members for products and services purchased from merchants that have ceased operations or stopped\naccepting our cards. For example, we are exposed to credit risk in the airline industry to the extent we protect Card Members against non-delivery of goods and\n® ®\n26\nTable of Contents\nservices, such as where we have remitted payment to an airline for a Card Member purchase of tickets that have not yet been used or “flown.” If we are unable to\ncollect the amount from the airline, we may bear the loss for the amount credited to the Card Member. At December 31, 2020, our best estimate of the maximum\namount of billed business volumes for goods and services that had yet to be delivered by, or could be charged back to, merchants was $19 billion. This amount\nassumes all such merchants worldwide cease operations and thus are no longer available to deliver such goods and services or to accept such chargebacks, and that\nall such billed business results in claims-in-full by Card Members. Such a maximum amount has not been indicative of our actual loss exposure in the past and we\nhave not experienced significant losses related to these exposures to date; however, our historical experience may not be representative in the current environment\ngiven the economic and financial disruptions, particularly to travel, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting containment measures. See Note 12 to the\n“Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information regarding this exposure.\nFor additional information relating to the general risks related to the airline industry, see “Risk Management—Institutional Credit Risk—Exposure to the Airline\nand Travel Industry” under “MD&A.”\nWe face continued intense competitive pressure that may materially impact the prices we charge for accepting our cards for payment for goods and services, as\nwell as the risk of losing merchant relationships, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nWe face pressure from competitors that primarily rely on sources of revenue other than discount revenue or have lower costs that can make their pricing for card\nacceptance more attractive. Merchants, business partners and third-party merchant acquirers and aggregators are also able to negotiate incentives, pricing\nconcessions and other contractual benefits from us as a condition to accepting our cards, being cobrand partners or signing merchants on our behalf. As merchants\nbecome even larger (such as the largest tech companies), we may have to increase the amount of incentives and/or concessions we provide to such merchants. We\nalso face the risk of losing a merchant relationship that could materially adversely affect our billed business volumes, ability to retain current Card Members and\nattract new Card Members and therefore, our business and results of operations.\nOur average merchant discount rate has been impacted by regulatory changes affecting competitor pricing in certain international countries. We have also\nexperienced erosion of our average merchant discount rate as we increase merchant acceptance. We may not be successful in significantly expanding merchant\nacceptance or offsetting rate erosion with volumes at new merchants.\nIn addition, the regulatory environment and differentiated payment models and technologies from non-traditional players in the alternative payments space could\npose challenges to our traditional payment model and adversely impact our average merchant discount rate. Some merchants continue to invest in their own\npayment solutions, such as proprietary-branded mobile wallets, using both traditional and new technology platforms. If merchants are able to drive broad consumer\nadoption and usage, it could adversely impact our average merchant discount rate and billed business volumes.\nA continuing priority of ours is to drive greater and differentiated value to our merchants that, if not successful, could negatively impact our discount revenue and\nfinancial results. We may not succeed in maintaining merchant discount rates or offsetting the impact of declining merchant discount rates, for the reasons\ndiscussed above and others, which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability, and therefore our ability to invest in innovation and in\nvalue-added services for merchants and Card Members.\nSurcharging or steering by merchants could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn certain countries, such as Australia and certain Member States in the EU, merchants are expressly permitted by law to surcharge certain card purchases. In\njurisdictions allowing surcharging, we have seen merchant surcharging on American Express cards in certain merchant categories, and in some cases, either the\nsurcharge is greater than that applied to Visa and Mastercard cards or Visa and Mastercard cards are not surcharged at all (practices that are known as differential\nsurcharging), even though there are many cards issued on competing networks that have an equal or greater cost of acceptance for the merchant. In addition, the\nlaws of a number of states in the United States that prohibit surcharging have been overturned in litigation brought by merchant groups.\nWe also encounter merchants that accept our cards, but tell their customers that they prefer to accept another type of payment or otherwise seek to suppress use of\nour cards. Our Card Members value the ability to use their cards where and when they want to, and we, therefore, take steps to meet our Card Members’\nexpectations and to protect the American Express brand by prohibiting this form of discrimination, subject to local legal requirements. When we work with\nmerchant acquirers, aggregators and processors to manage certain aspects of the merchant relationship, we are dependent on them to promote and support the\nacceptance and usage of our cards, but such third parties may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours.\nIf surcharging, steering or other forms of discrimination become widespread, American Express cards and credit and charge cards generally could become less\ndesirable to consumers, which could result in a decrease in cards-in-force and transaction\n27\nTable of Contents\nvolumes. The impact could vary depending on such factors as: the industry or manner in which a surcharge is levied; how Card Members are surcharged or steered\nto other card products or payment forms at the point of sale; the ease and speed of implementation for merchants, including as a result of new or emerging\ntechnologies; the size and recurrence of the underlying charges; and whether and to what extent these actions are applied to other forms of payment, including\nwhether it varies depending on the type of card (e.g., credit or debit), product, network, acquirer or issuer. Discrimination against American Express cards could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts credit card\nusage, our Card Members or our business.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to promote card usage through marketing and promotion, merchant acceptance and Card Member rewards and\nservices, or to effectively control the costs of such investments, both of which may materially impact our profitability.\nRevenue growth is dependent on increasing consumer and business spending on our cards, growing loan balances and increasing fee revenue. We have been\ninvesting in a number of growth initiatives, including to attract new Card Members, reduce Card Member attrition and capture a greater share of customers’ total\nspending and borrowings. There can be no assurance that our investments to acquire Card Members, provide differentiated features and services and increase usage\nof our cards will continue to be effective, particularly with changing consumer and business behaviors as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, if we\ndevelop new products or offers that attract customers looking for short-term incentives rather than incentivize long-term loyalty, Card Member attrition and costs\ncould increase. Increasing spending on our cards also depends on our continued expansion of merchant acceptance of our cards. If we are unable to continue\ngrowing merchant acceptance and perceptions of coverage or merchants decide to no longer accept American Express cards, our business could suffer. Expanding\nour service offerings, adding customer acquisition channels and forming new partnerships or renewing current partnerships could have higher costs than our\ncurrent arrangements, and could adversely impact our average discount rate or dilute our brand.\nAnother way we invest in customer value is through our Membership Rewards program, as well as other Card Member benefits. Any significant change in, or\nfailure by management to reasonably estimate, actual redemptions of Membership Rewards points and associated redemption costs could adversely affect our\nprofitability. We rely on third parties for certain redemption options and may not be able to continue to offer such redemption options in the future, which could\ndiminish the value of the program for our Card Members. Our two largest redemption partners are Amazon and Delta. In addition, many credit card issuers have\ninstituted rewards and cobrand programs and may introduce programs and services that are similar to or more attractive than ours. Our inability to differentiate our\nproducts and services could materially adversely affect us.\nWe may not be able to cost-effectively manage and expand Card Member benefits, including containing the growth of marketing, promotion, rewards and Card\nMember services expenses in the future. If such expenses increase beyond our expectations, we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing\npayment volumes, increasing other areas of revenues such as fee-based revenues, or both. We may not succeed in doing so, particularly in the current competitive\nand regulatory environment.\nOur brand and reputation are key assets of our Company, and our business may be materially affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace.\nOur brand and its attributes are key assets, and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve, grow and realize the benefits of the value of\nour brand. Our ability to attract and retain consumer and small business Card Members and corporate clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of\nour level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, privacy and data protection, management, workplace culture, merchant acceptance, financial condition,\nresponse to political and social issues or catastrophic events (including our response to the COVID-19 pandemic and natural disasters) and other subjective\nqualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters — even if related to seemingly isolated incidents and whether or not factually correct—could\nerode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential Card Members, corporate clients, merchants and partners, which could make it\ndifficult for us to attract new customers and maintain existing ones. Negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities\nor circumstances, including card practices, regulatory compliance, the use and protection of customer information, conduct by our colleagues and policy\nengagement, including activities of the American Express Company Political Action Committee, and from actions taken by regulators or others in response thereto.\nDiscussion about such matters in social media channels can also cause rapid, widespread reputational harm to our brand.\nOur brand and reputation may also be harmed by actions taken by third parties that are outside our control. For example, any shortcoming of or controversy related\nto a third-party vendor, business partner, merchant acquirer or network partner may be attributed by Card Members and merchants to us, thus damaging our\nreputation and brand value. Acceptance of American Express cards by merchants in certain industries can also affect perceptions of us. The lack of acceptance,\nsuppression of card usage or surcharging by merchants can also negatively impact perceptions of our brand and our products, lower overall transaction volume and\nincrease the attractiveness of other payment products or systems. Adverse developments with respect to our industry may also, by association, negatively impact\nour reputation, or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or\n28\nTable of Contents\nlitigation against us. Furthermore, as a corporation with headquarters and operations located in the United States, a negative perception of the United States arising\nfrom its political or other positions could harm the perception of our company and our brand. Although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our\nreputation and brand, negative perceptions or publicity could materially and adversely affect our business volumes, revenues and profitability.\nA major information or cyber security incident or an increase in fraudulent activity could lead to reputational damage to our brand and material legal,\nregulatory and financial exposure, and could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards.\nWe and third parties process, transmit, store and provide access to account information in connection with our charge and credit cards and other products, and in\nthe normal course of our business, we collect, analyze and retain significant volumes of certain types of personally identifiable and other information pertaining to\nour customers and colleagues.\nOur networks and systems are subject to constant attempts to identify and exploit potential vulnerabilities in our operating environment with intent to disrupt our\nbusiness operations and capture, destroy, manipulate or expose various types of information relating to corporate trade secrets, customer information, including\nCard Member, travel and loyalty program data, colleague information and other sensitive business information, including acquisition activity, non-public financial\nresults and intellectual property. There are a number of motivations for cyber threat actors, including criminal activities such as fraud, identity theft and ransom,\ncorporate or nation-state espionage, political agendas, public embarrassment with the intent to cause financial or reputational harm, intent to disrupt information\ntechnology systems, and to expose and exploit potential security and privacy vulnerabilities in corporate systems and websites.\nGlobal financial institutions like us, as well as our customers, colleagues, regulators, vendors and other third parties, have experienced a significant increase in\ninformation and cyber security risk in recent years and will likely continue to be the target of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, including computer viruses,\nmalicious or destructive code, ransomware, social engineering attacks (including phishing, impersonation and identity takeover attempts), corporate espionage,\nhacking, website defacement, denial-of-service attacks, exploitation of vulnerabilities and other attacks and similar disruptions from the misconfiguration or\nunauthorized use of or access to computer systems. For example, we and other U.S. financial services providers have been the target of distributed denial-ofservice attacks from sophisticated third parties. These threats can arise from external parties as well as insiders who knowingly or unknowingly engage in or enable\nmalicious cyber activities.\nWe develop and maintain systems and processes aimed at detecting and preventing information and cyber security incidents and fraudulent activity, which require\nsignificant investment, maintenance and ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and regulatory requirements change and as efforts to overcome security\nmeasures become more sophisticated. Despite our efforts, the possibility of information and cyber security incidents, malicious social engineering, corporate\nespionage, fraudulent or other malicious activities and human error or malfeasance cannot be eliminated entirely and will evolve as new and emerging technology\nis deployed, including the increasing use of personal mobile and computing devices that are outside of our network and control environments. Risks associated\nwith such incidents and activities include theft of funds and other monetary loss, the disruption of our operations and the unauthorized disclosure, release,\ngathering, monitoring, misuse, modification, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary, trade secret or other information (including account data information),\nthe effects of which could be compounded if not detected or reported quickly. Indeed, an information or cyber security incident may not be detected until well after\nit occurs and the severity and potential impact may not be fully known for a substantial period of time after it has been discovered.\nInformation or cyber security incidents, fraudulent activity and other actual or perceived failures to maintain confidentiality, integrity, privacy and/or security has\nled to increased regulatory scrutiny and may lead to regulatory investigations and intervention (such as mandatory card reissuance), increased litigation (including\nclass action litigation), remediation, fines and response costs, negative assessments of us and our subsidiaries by banking regulators and rating agencies,\nreputational and financial damage to our brand, and reduced usage of our products and services, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe disclosure of sensitive company information could also undermine our competitive advantage and divert management attention and resources.\nSuccessful cyberattacks, data breaches, disruptions or other incidents related to the actual or perceived failures to maintain confidentiality, integrity, privacy and/or\nsecurity at other large financial institutions, large retailers, travel and hospitality companies, government agencies or other market participants, whether or not we\nare impacted, could lead to a general loss of customer confidence that could negatively affect us, including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of\nour security measures or harming the reputation of the financial system in general, which could result in reduced use of our products and services. Such events\ncould also result in legislation and additional regulatory requirements. Although we maintain cyber insurance, there can be no assurance that liabilities or losses we\nmay incur will be covered under such policies or that the amount of insurance will be adequate.\nThe uninterrupted operation of our information systems is critical to our success and a significant disruption could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness and results of operations.\n29\nTable of Contents\nOur information technology systems, including our transaction authorization, clearing and settlement systems, and data centers, may experience service disruptions\nor degradation because of technology malfunction, sudden increases in customer transaction volume, natural disasters, accidents, power outages, internet outages,\ntelecommunications failures, fraud, denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, terrorism, computer viruses, vulnerabilities in hardware or software, physical or\nelectronic break-ins, or similar events. Service disruptions or degradations could prevent access to our online services and account information, compromise or\nlimit access to company or customer data, impede transaction processing and financial reporting, and lead to regulatory investigations and fines, increased\nregulatory oversight and litigation (including class action litigation). Any such service disruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of the\nreliability of our products and services and materially adversely affect our overall business, reputation and results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party providers for acquiring and servicing customers, technology, platforms and other services integral to the operations of our businesses.\nThese third parties may act in ways that could materially harm our business.\nWe rely on third-party service providers, cobrand partners, merchants, customer acquisition channels, processors, aggregators, network partners and other third\nparties for services that are integral to our operations and are subject to the risk that activities of such third parties may adversely affect our business. As\noutsourcing, specialization of functions, third-party digital services and technology innovation within the payments industry increase (including with respect to\nmobile technologies, tokenization, big data, artificial intelligence and cloud storage solutions), more third parties are involved in processing card transactions and\nhandling our data. For example, we rely on third parties for the timely transmission of accurate information across our global network, card acquisition and\nprovision of services to our customers. If a service provider or other third party ceases to provide the data quality or communications capacity we expect or\nservices upon which we rely, as a result of natural disaster, operational disruptions or errors, including as a result of the impacts of COVID-19, terrorism,\ninformation or cyber security incidents, or any other reason, the failure could interrupt or compromise the quality of our services to customers or impact our\nbusiness. A disruption or other event at a third party affecting one of our service providers or partners could also impede their ability to provide to us services or\ndata on which we rely to operate our business. Service providers or other third parties could also cease providing data to us or use our data in a way that diminishes\nthe value of our closed loop.\nThe confidentiality, integrity, privacy, availability and/or security of data communicated over third-party networks or platforms or held by, or accessible to, third\nparties, including merchants that accept our cards, payment processors, payment intermediaries and our third-party vendors and business partners, could become\ncompromised, which could lead to unauthorized use of our data or fraudulent transactions on our cards, as well as costs associated with responding to such an\nincident, including regulatory investigations and fines, increased regulatory oversight and litigation.\nThe management and oversight of multiple vendors increases our operational complexity and governance challenges and decreases our control. A failure to\nexercise adequate oversight over service providers, including compliance with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements, could result in\nregulatory actions, fines, litigation, sanctions or economic and reputational harm to us. In addition, we may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate\noperational risks relating to our third-party providers' service providers. We are also exposed to the risk that a service disruption at a service provider common to\nour third-party providers could impede their ability to provide services to us. Notwithstanding any attempts to diversify our reliance on third parties, we may not be\nable to effectively mitigate operational risks relating to our third-party providers’ use of common service providers.\nIf we are not able to invest successfully in, and compete at the leading edge of, technological developments across all our businesses, our revenue and\nprofitability could be materially adversely affected.\nOur industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes. In order to compete in our industry, we need to continue to invest in technology across all\nareas of our business, including in transaction processing, data management and analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence, customer interactions and\ncommunications, open banking and alternative payment and financing mechanisms, authentication technologies and digital identification, tokenization, real-time\nsettlement, and risk management and compliance systems. Incorporating new technologies into our products and services, including developing the appropriate\ngovernance and controls consistent with regulatory expectations, requires substantial expenditures and takes considerable time, and ultimately may not be\nsuccessful. We expect that new technologies in the payments industry will continue to emerge, and these new technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete,\nour existing technology.\nThe process of developing new products and services, enhancing existing products and services and adapting to technological changes and evolving industry\nstandards is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could\nsignificantly impede our ability to compete effectively. Consumer and merchant adoption is a key competitive factor and our competitors may develop products,\nplatforms or technologies that become more widely adopted than ours. In addition, we may underestimate the time and expense we must invest in new products\nand services before they generate significant revenues, if at all. Our use of artificial intelligence and machine learning is subject to risks related to flaws in our\nalgorithms and datasets that may be insufficient or contain biased information. These deficiencies could undermine the decisions, predictions or analysis such\ntechnologies produce, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm.\n30\nTable of Contents\nOur ability to develop, acquire or access competitive technologies or business processes on acceptable terms may also be limited by intellectual property rights that\nthird parties, including those that current and potential competitors, may assert. In addition, our ability to adopt new technologies may be inhibited by the\nemergence of industry-wide standards, a changing legislative and regulatory environment, an inability to develop appropriate governance and controls, a lack of\ninternal product and engineering expertise, resistance to change from Card Members or merchants, lack of appropriate change management processes or the\ncomplexity of our systems.\nWe may not be successful in realizing the benefits associated with our acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and investment activity, and our business\nand reputation could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have acquired a number of businesses, including Kabbage, and have made a number of strategic investments, and continue to evaluate potential transactions.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, value potential investment or acquisition opportunities accurately, negotiate\nacceptable terms for those opportunities, or complete proposed acquisitions and investments. The process of integrating an acquired company, business or\ntechnology could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, result in unanticipated liabilities, including legal claims, violations of laws, commercial\ndisputes and information security vulnerabilities or breaches (including from not integrating the acquired company, business or technology quickly or\nappropriately, from activities that occurred prior to the acquisition, and from exposure to third party relationships of the acquired company or business or new laws\nand regulations), and harm our business generally. It may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions, and those\nbenefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could materially adversely affect our business and operating results,\nincluding as a result of write-downs of goodwill and other intangible assets.\nWe may also face risks with other types of strategic transactions, such as the sale to InComm of the operations relating to our prepaid reloadable and gift card\nbusiness. The reloadable operations have experienced disruptions in the past, impacting the ability of our prepaid customers to load and use their cards. If such\noperations are interrupted, suspended or terminated in the future, it could further negatively impact our customers’ experience, result in additional costs, litigation\nand regulatory action, and harm our business and reputation.\nJoint ventures, including our GBT JV and our joint venture in China, and minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business\noperations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational and/or compliance risks associated with the joint venture or minority investment,\nincluding as a result of becoming subject to different laws or regulations. In addition, we may be dependent on joint venture partners, controlling shareholders or\nmanagement who may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours. For example, trade secrets and other proprietary information we\nmay provide to a joint venture may become available to third parties beyond our control. The ability to enforce intellectual property and contractual rights to\nprevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information may be limited in certain jurisdictions. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of\nthe joint venture partner, controlling shareholders or management may adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against\nus and otherwise damage our reputation and brand.\nOur success is dependent on maintaining a culture of integrity and respect, the resilience of our colleagues through the pandemic, and upon our executive\nofficers and other key personnel, and misconduct by or loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe rely upon our key personnel not only for business success, but also to lead with integrity and promote a culture of respect. To the extent our leaders behave in a\nmanner that does not comport with our company’s values, the consequences to our brand and reputation could be severe and could negatively affect our financial\ncondition and results of operations. Our colleagues have had to adapt to rapidly changing conditions during the pandemic, and if we are unable to continue\naddressing the safety, health and productivity of our colleagues, our business could suffer.\nThe market for qualified individuals is highly competitive, and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed\nmembers of our senior management team or other key personnel who voluntarily or involuntarily leave the company. Changes in immigration and work permit\nlaws and regulations or the administration or enforcement of such laws or regulations or other changes in the legal or regulatory environment, including as a result\nof Brexit, can also impair our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, or to employ such personnel in the location(s) of our choice. Our compensation\npractices are subject to review and oversight by the Federal Reserve and the compensation practices of AENB are subject to review and oversight by the OCC.\nThis regulatory review and oversight could further affect our ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key personnel. The loss of key personnel\ncould materially adversely affect our business.\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks\nOur business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\n31\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world, which significantly affects our business and requires\ncontinual enhancement of our compliance efforts. Supervision efforts and the enforcement of existing laws and regulations impact the scope and profitability of our\nexisting business activities, limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities and adopt new technologies, compromise our competitive position, and affect\nour relationships with Card Members, partners, merchants, vendors and other third parties. New laws or regulations could similarly affect our business, increase\nour costs of doing business and require us to change certain of our business practices and invest significant management attention and resources, all of which could\nadversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Legislators and regulators around the world are aware of each other’s approaches to the\nregulation of the payments industry. Consequently, a development in one country, state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another. To the extent\nthat different regulatory systems impose overlapping or inconsistent requirements on the conduct of our business, we face complexity and additional costs in our\ncompliance efforts.\nIf we fail to satisfy regulatory requirements or maintain our financial holding company status, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely\naffected, and we may be restricted in our ability to take certain capital actions (such as declaring dividends or repurchasing outstanding shares) or engage in certain\nbusiness activities or acquisitions, which could compromise our competitive position. Additionally, our banking regulators have wide discretion in the examination\nand the enforcement of applicable banking statutes and regulations and may restrict our ability to engage in certain business activities or acquisitions or require us\nto maintain more capital.\nIn recent years, legislators and regulators have focused on the operation of card networks, including interchange fees paid to card issuers in payment networks such\nas Visa and Mastercard and the fees merchants are charged to accept cards. Even where we are not directly regulated, regulation of bankcard fees significantly\nnegatively impacts the discount revenue derived from our business, including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor\npricing in connection with caps on interchange fees. In some cases, regulations also extend to certain aspects of our business, such as network and cobrand\narrangements or the terms of card acceptance for merchants, including terms relating to non-discrimination and honor-all-cards. For example, we have exited our\nnetwork businesses in the EU and Australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions. In addition, there is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps\nand other provisions of the EU payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the EU. In a ruling issued on February 7,\n2018, the EU Court of Justice confirmed the validity of the application of the fee caps and other provisions in circumstances where three-party networks issue cards\nwith a cobrand partner or through an agent, although the ruling provided only limited guidance as to when or how the provisions might apply in such circumstances\nand remains subject to differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements. As a result, we are subject to regulatory action, penalties\nand the possibility we will not be able to maintain our existing cobrand and agent relationships in the EU.\nWe are subject to certain provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the Patriot Act and the AMLA, with regard to maintaining effective AML programs.\nSimilar AML requirements apply under the laws of most jurisdictions where we operate. As regulators increase their focus in this area, we are likely to face\nincreased costs related to oversight, supervision and fines and changes to our business practices, including restrictions with respect to the types of products and\nservices we may offer, the countries in which our cards may be used, and the types of customers and merchants who can obtain or accept our cards. Emerging\ntechnologies, such as digital currencies, could limit our ability to track the movement of funds. Money laundering, terrorist financing and other illicit activities\ninvolving our business could result in enforcement action, and our reputation may suffer due to our customers’ association with certain countries, persons or\nentities or the existence of any such transactions.\nVarious regulatory agencies and legislatures are also considering regulations and legislation covering identity theft, account management guidelines, credit bureau\nreporting, disclosure rules, security and marketing that would impact us directly, in part due to increased scrutiny of our underwriting and account management\nstandards. These new requirements may restrict our ability to issue charge and credit cards or partner with other financial institutions, which could adversely affect\nour revenue growth.\nSee “Supervision and Regulation” for more information about certain laws and regulations to which we are subject and their impact on us.\nLitigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments and/or requirements resulting in significantly increased expenses,\ndamage to our reputation and/or a material adverse effect on our business.\nBusinesses in the financial services and payments industries have historically been subject to significant legal actions, including class action lawsuits. Many of\nthese actions have included claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages. While we have historically relied on our arbitration clause in agreements\nwith customers to limit our exposure to class action litigation, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in\nthe future, including as a result of regulation that would require that our consumer arbitration clause not apply to cases filed in court as class actions, and claims of\nthe type we previously arbitrated could be subject to the complexities, risks and costs associated with class action cases. The continued focus of merchants on\nissues relating to the acceptance of various forms of payment may lead to additional litigation and other legal actions. Given the inherent uncertainties involved in\nlitigation, and the very large or indeterminate\n32\nTable of Contents\ndamages sought in some matters asserted against us, there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from litigation.\nWe have been subject to regulatory actions and may continue to be subject to such actions, including governmental inquiries, investigations and enforcement\nproceedings, in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations. External publicity concerning investigations, including those that\nare narrow in scope, can increase their scope and scale and lead to further regulatory inquiries. Beginning in May 2020, we began responding to a regulatory\nreview led by the OCC and the Department of Justice Civil Division regarding historical sales practices relating to certain small business card sales. We also\nconducted an internal review of certain sales from 2015 and 2016 and have taken appropriate disciplinary and remedial actions, including voluntarily providing\nremediation to certain current and former customers. Information regarding our investigation has been provided to our other regulators, including the Federal\nReserve. In January 2021, we received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York regarding the sales\npractices for small business cards and a Civil Investigative Demand from the CFPB seeking information on sales practices related to consumers. We are\ncooperating with all of these inquiries and have continued to enhance our controls related to our sales practices. We do not believe this matter will have a material\nadverse impact on our business or results of operations.\nWe expect that regulators will continue taking formal enforcement actions against financial institutions in addition to addressing supervisory concerns through\nnon-public supervisory actions or findings, which could involve restrictions on our activities, among other limitations that could adversely affect our business. In\naddition, a violation of law or regulation by another financial institution could give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the\nsame or similar practices by us. Further, a single event may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings. Regulatory action could subject\nus to significant fines, penalties or other requirements resulting in Card Member reimbursements, increased expenses, limitations or conditions on our business\nactivities, and damage to our reputation and our brand, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nGovernmental authorities have adopted or proposed measures to provide economic assistance to individual households and businesses, stabilize markets and\nsupport economic growth. The future success of these measures is unknown and they may not be sufficient to mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic.\nAdditionally, some measures, such as a suspension of loan payments and encouragement of forbearances, may have a negative impact on our business, results of\noperations and financial condition. We also face an increased risk of litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of the pandemic\non market and economic conditions, such as a renewed focus on fair lending laws, and actions governmental authorities take in response to those conditions,\nincluding participation in the PPP.\nLegal proceedings regarding provisions in our merchant contracts, including non-discrimination and honor-all-cards provisions, could have a material\nadverse effect on our business and result in additional litigation and/or arbitrations, substantial monetary damages and damage to our reputation and brand.\nWe are, and have been in the past, a defendant in a number of actions, including legal proceedings and proposed class actions filed by merchants, challenging\ncertain provisions of our card acceptance agreements. See Note 12 to the \"Consolidated Financial Statements\" for a description of our outstanding material legal\nproceedings.\nAn adverse outcome in these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, require us to change our merchant\nagreements in a way that could expose our cards to increased merchant steering and other forms of discrimination that could impair the Card Member experience,\nresult in additional litigation and/or arbitrations, impose substantial monetary damages and damage our reputation and brand. Even if we were not required to\nchange our merchant agreements, changes in Visa’s and Mastercard’s policies or practices as a result of legal proceedings, lawsuit settlements or regulatory actions\npending against them could result in changes to our business practices and materially and adversely impact our profitability.\nWe are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity rules, and if we fail to meet these rules, our business would be materially adversely affected.\nFailure to meet current or future capital or liquidity requirements could compromise our competitive position and could result in restrictions imposed by the\nFederal Reserve, including limiting our ability to pay dividends, repurchase our capital stock, invest in our business, expand our business or engage in acquisitions.\nSome elements of the capital and liquidity regimes are not yet final and certain developments could significantly impact the requirements applicable to financial\ninstitutions. For example, the Basel Committee finalized revisions to the standardized approach for credit risk and operational risk capital requirements. If these\nrevisions are adopted in the United States, we could be required to hold significantly more capital. In addition, it may be necessary for us to hold additional capital\nbecause of an increase in the SCB requirement based on the results from a supervisory stress test.\nCompliance with capital adequacy and liquidity rules requires a material investment of resources. An inability to meet regulatory expectations regarding our\ncompliance with applicable capital adequacy and liquidity rules may also negatively impact the assessment of us and our U.S. bank subsidiary by federal banking\nregulators.\n33\nTable of Contents\nFor more information on capital adequacy requirements, see “Capital and Liquidity Regulation” under “Supervision and Regulation.”\nWe are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our capital stock. Our subsidiaries are also subject to restrictions that limit\ntheir ability to pay dividends to us, which may adversely affect our liquidity.\nWe are limited in our ability to pay dividends and repurchase capital stock by our regulators, who have broad authority to prohibit any action that would be\nconsidered an unsafe or unsound banking practice. For example, the Federal Reserve prohibited share repurchases in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 for all\nbanking organizations participating in CCAR and has limited distributions for the first quarter of 2021. We are subject to a requirement to submit capital plans to\nthe Federal Reserve for review that include, among other things, projected dividend payments and repurchases of capital stock. As part of the capital planning and\nstress testing process, our proposed capital actions are assessed against our ability to satisfy applicable capital requirements in the event of a stressed market\nenvironment. If we fail to satisfy applicable capital requirements, including the stress capital buffer, our ability to undertake capital actions may be restricted.\nOur ability to declare or pay dividends on, or to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of our common stock will be prohibited, subject to certain\nexceptions, in the event that we do not declare and pay in full dividends for the last preceding dividend period of our Series B and Series C preferred stock.\nAmerican Express Company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for liquidity, and such dividends may be limited by law, regulation or supervisory policy. For\nexample, our U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB, is subject to various statutory and regulatory limitations on its declaration and payment of dividends. These limitations\nmay hinder our ability to access funds we may need to make payments on our obligations, make dividend payments on outstanding American Express Company\ncapital stock or otherwise achieve strategic objectives.\nAny future reduction or elimination of our common stock dividend or share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and\nmarket perceptions of American Express. For more information on bank holding company and depository institution dividend restrictions, see “Stress Testing and\nCapital Planning” and “Dividends and Other Capital Distributions” under “Supervision and Regulation,” as well as “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity\n—Dividends and Share Repurchases” under “MD&A” and Note 22 to our “Consolidated Financial Statements.”\nRegulation in the areas of privacy, data protection, data governance, account access and information and cyber security could increase our costs and affect or\nlimit our business opportunities and how we collect and/or use personal information.\nLegislators and regulators in the United States and other countries in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, data protection, data\ngovernance, account access and information and cyber security laws, including data localization, authentication and notification laws. As such laws are interpreted\nand applied (in some cases, with significant differences or conflicting requirements across jurisdictions), compliance and technology costs will continue to\nincrease, particularly in the context of ensuring that adequate data governance, data protection, data transfer and account access mechanisms are in place.\nCompliance with current or future privacy, data protection, data governance, account access and information and cyber security laws could significantly impact our\ncollection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer and/or colleague information and could restrict our ability to fully maximize our closed-loop\ncapability or provide certain products and services, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability. Our failure to comply with such laws could result\nin potentially significant regulatory and/or governmental investigations and/or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions, ongoing regulatory monitoring, customer\nattrition, decreases in the use or acceptance of our cards and damage to our reputation and our brand. In recent years, there has been increasing regulatory\nenforcement and litigation activity in the areas of privacy, data protection and information and cyber security in the United States, the EU and various other\ncountries in which we operate.\nFor more information on regulatory and legislative activity in this area, see “Privacy, Data Protection, Data Governance, Information and Cyber Security” under\n“Supervision and Regulation.”\nWe may not be able to effectively manage the operational and compliance risks to which we are exposed.\nWe consider operational risk to be the risk of loss due to, among other things, inadequate or failed processes, people or information systems, or impacts from the\nexternal environment (e.g., natural disasters). Operational risk includes, among others, the risk that error or misconduct could result in a material financial\nmisstatement, a failure to monitor a third party’s compliance with regulatory or legal requirements, or a failure to adequately monitor and control access to, or use\nof, data in our systems we grant to third parties. As processes or organizations are changed, or new products and services are introduced, we may not fully\nappreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes. Through human error, fraud or malfeasance, conduct risk can result in harm to\ncustomers, broader markets and the company and its employees.\nCompliance risk arises from the failure to adhere to applicable laws, rules, regulations and internal policies and procedures. We need to continually update and\nenhance our control environment to address operational and compliance risks. Operational and compliance failures or deficiencies in our control environment can\nexpose us to reputational and legal risks as well as fines,\n34\nTable of Contents\ncivil money penalties or payment of damages and can lead to diminished business opportunities and diminished ability to expand key operations.\nIf we are not able to protect our intellectual property, or successfully defend against any infringement or misappropriation assertions brought against us, our\nrevenue and profitability could be negatively affected.\nWe rely on a variety of measures to protect our intellectual property and control access to, and distribution of, our trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nThese measures may not prevent infringement of our intellectual property rights or misappropriation of our proprietary information and a resulting loss of\ncompetitive advantage. The ability to enforce intellectual property rights to prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information may be limited\nin certain jurisdictions. In addition, competitors or other third parties may allege that our products, systems, processes or technologies infringe on their intellectual\nproperty rights. Given the complex, rapidly changing and competitive technological and business environments in which we operate, and the potential risks and\nuncertainties of intellectual property-related litigation, a future assertion of an infringement or misappropriation claim against us could cause us to lose significant\nrevenues, incur significant defense, license, royalty or technology development expenses, and/or pay significant monetary damages.\nTax legislative initiatives or assessments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. The laws and regulations related to tax matters are extremely\ncomplex and subject to varying interpretations. Although management believes our positions are reasonable, we are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue\nService in the United States and by tax authorities in all the jurisdictions in which we conduct business operations. We are being challenged in a number of\ncountries regarding our application of value-added taxes (VAT) to certain transactions. While we believe we comply with all applicable VAT and other tax laws,\nrules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, the tax authorities may determine that we owe additional taxes or apply existing laws and regulations more\nbroadly, which could result in a significant increase in liabilities for taxes and interest in excess of accrued liabilities.\nNew tax legislative initiatives, including increases in the corporate tax rate, may be enacted, impacting our effective tax rate and potentially adversely affecting our\ntax positions or tax liabilities. In addition, unilateral or multi-jurisdictional actions by various tax authorities, including an increase in tax audit activity, could have\nan adverse impact on our tax liabilities.\nCredit, Liquidity and Market Risks\nOur risk management policies and procedures may not be effective.\nOur risk management framework seeks to identify and mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return. Although we have devoted significant resources to\ndevelop our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future, these policies and procedures, as well as our risk management\ntechniques, such as our hedging strategies, may not be fully effective. There may also be risks that exist, or develop in the future, that we have not appropriately\nidentified or mitigated. As regulations and competition continue to evolve, our risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those\nchanges. If our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks, we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely\naffected.\nManagement of our risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical and/or forecasting models. Although we have a governance framework for model\ndevelopment and independent model validation, the modeling methodology or key assumptions could be erroneous or the models could be misused. In addition,\nissues with the quality or effectiveness of our data aggregation and validation procedures, as well as the quality and integrity of data inputs, could result in\nineffective or inaccurate model outputs and reports. For example, models based on historical data sets might not be accurate predictors of future outcomes and their\nability to appropriately predict future outcomes may degrade over time. The CECL methodology requires measurement of expected credit losses for the estimated\nlife of certain financial instruments, not only based on historical experience and current conditions, but also by including forecasts incorporating forward-looking\ninformation. Our ability to accurately forecast future losses under that methodology may be impaired by the significant uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and\nthe lack of comparable precedent. If our business decisions or estimates for credit losses are based on incorrect or misused models and assumptions or we fail to\nmanage data inputs effectively and to aggregate or analyze data in an accurate and timely manner, our results of operations and financial condition may be\nmaterially adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to credit risk and trends that affect Card Member spending and the ability of customers and partners to pay us, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to both individual credit risk, principally from consumer and small business Card Member loans and receivables, and institutional credit risk,\nprincipally from corporate Card Member loans and receivables, merchants, network partners, loyalty coalition partners and treasury and investment counterparties.\nThird parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. General economic factors, such as\nGDP, unemployment, inflation and interest rates, may result in greater delinquencies that lead to greater credit losses. A customer’s ability and willingness to repay\nus can be negatively impacted not only by economic, market, political and social conditions but\n35\nTable of Contents\nalso by a customer’s other payment obligations, and increasing leverage can result in a higher risk that customers will default or become delinquent in their\nobligations to us. Our caution about the potential for a significant downturn in the pace of economic recovery is reflected in the macroeconomic outlook that\ninforms our reserves for credit losses.\nWe rely principally on the customer’s creditworthiness for repayment of loans or receivables and therefore have no other recourse for collection. Our ability to\nassess creditworthiness may be impaired if the criteria or models we use to manage our credit risk prove inaccurate in predicting future losses, which could cause\nour losses to rise and have a negative impact on our results of operations. Further, our pricing strategies may not offset the negative impact on profitability caused\nby increases in delinquencies and losses; thus any material increases in delinquencies and losses beyond our current estimates could have a material adverse impact\non us. Although we make estimates to provide for credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of loans and receivables, these estimates may not be accurate. In\naddition, the information we use in managing our credit risk may be inaccurate or incomplete.\nRising delinquencies and rising rates of bankruptcy are often precursors of future write-offs and may require us to increase our reserve for credit losses. Higher\nwrite-off rates and the resulting increase in our reserves for credit losses adversely affect our profitability and the performance of our securitizations, and may\nincrease our cost of funds.\nAlthough we regularly review our credit exposure to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries, countries and regions that we believe may present\ncredit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to foresee or detect, such as fraud. In addition, our ability to manage credit\nrisk or collect amounts owed to us may be adversely affected by legal or regulatory changes (such as restrictions on collections or changes in bankruptcy laws,\nminimum payment regulations and re-age guidance). Increased credit risk, whether resulting from underestimating the credit losses inherent in our portfolio of\nloans and receivables, deteriorating economic conditions (particularly in the United States where, for example, Card Members were responsible for approximately\n87 percent of our total Card Member loans outstanding as of December 31, 2020), increases in the level of loan balances, changes in our mix of business or\notherwise, could require us to increase our provisions for losses and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nInterest rate changes could materially adversely affect our earnings.\nOur interest expense was approximately $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. If the rate of interest we pay on our borrowings increases more or\ndecreases less than the rate of interest we earn on our loans, our net interest yield, and consequently our net interest income, could decrease. As of December 31,\n2020, a hypothetical immediate 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have a detrimental impact on our annual net interest income of up to $113\nmillion. A hypothetical immediate 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates would have a smaller but still detrimental impact on our annual net interest\nincome. We expect the rates we pay on our deposits will change if benchmark interest rates change. In addition, interest rate changes may affect customer\nbehavior, such as impacting the loan balances Card Members carry on their credit cards or their ability to make payments as higher interest rates lead to higher\npayment requirements, further impacting our results of operations. For a further discussion of our interest rate risk, see “Risk Management ― Market Risk\nManagement Process” under “MD&A.”\nThe discontinuance of LIBOR may negatively impact our access to funding and the value of our financial instruments and commercial agreements.\nCentral banks and global regulators have called for financial market participants to prepare for the discontinuance of the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)\nand the establishment of alternative reference rates. Certain of our financial instruments and commercial agreements reference LIBOR, which will need to be\namended or otherwise modified to replace LIBOR with an alternative reference rate. Some of those instruments and agreements contain provisions to replace\nLIBOR as the benchmark following the occurrence of specified transition events. Such provisions may not be sufficient to trigger a change in the benchmark at all\ntimes when LIBOR is no longer representative of market interest rates, or that these events will align with similar events in the market generally or in other parts of\nthe financial markets, such as the derivatives market.\nAlternative reference rates are calculated using components different from those used in the calculation of LIBOR and may fluctuate differently than, and not be\nrepresentative of, LIBOR. In order to compensate for these differences, certain of our financial instruments and commercial agreements allow for a benchmark\nreplacement adjustment. However, there is no assurance that any benchmark replacement adjustment will be sufficient to produce the economic equivalent of\nLIBOR, either at the benchmark replacement date or over the life of such instruments and agreements.\nUncertainty as to the nature and timing of the potential discontinuance or modification of LIBOR, the replacement of LIBOR with one or more alternative\nreference rates or other reforms may negatively impact market liquidity, our access to funding and the trading market for our financial instruments. Furthermore,\nthe timing of implementation and use of alternative reference rates and corresponding adjustments or other reforms could be subject to disputes, could cause the\ninterest payable on our outstanding financial instruments and commercial agreements to be materially different than expected and may impact the value of such\ninstruments and agreements.\n36\nTable of Contents\nAdverse market conditions may significantly affect our access to, and cost of, capital and ability to meet liquidity needs.\nOur ability to obtain financing in the debt capital markets for unsecured term debt and asset securitizations is dependent on financial market conditions.\nDisruptions, uncertainty or volatility across the financial markets, as well as adverse developments affecting our competitors and the financial industry generally,\ncould negatively impact market liquidity and limit our access to funding required to operate our business. Such market conditions may also limit our ability to\nreplace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities, satisfy regulatory capital requirements and access the funding necessary to grow our business. In some\ncircumstances, we may incur an unattractive cost to raise capital, which could decrease profitability and significantly reduce financial flexibility. For a further\ndiscussion of our liquidity and funding needs, see “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity” under “MD&A.”\nAny reduction in our and our subsidiaries’ credit ratings could increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets and have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRating agencies regularly evaluate us and our subsidiaries, and their ratings of our and our subsidiaries’ long-term and short-term debt and deposits are based on a\nnumber of factors, including financial strength, as well as factors not within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally,\nand the wider state of the economy. Our and our subsidiaries’ ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any of the rating agencies, which\ncould, among other things, adversely limit our access to the capital markets and adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we and our subsidiaries are\nable to obtain funding.\nAdverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease earnings we receive from our international operations and impact our capital.\nDuring 2020, approximately 22 percent of our total revenues net of interest expense were generated from activities outside the United States. We are exposed to\nforeign exchange risk from our international operations, and accordingly the revenue we generate outside the United States is subject to unpredictable fluctuations\nif the values of other currencies change relative to the U.S. dollar (including as a result of Brexit), which could have a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations.\nForeign exchange regulations or capital controls might restrict or prohibit the conversion of other currencies into U.S. dollars or our ability to transfer them.\nPolitical and economic conditions in other countries could also impact the availability of foreign exchange for the payment to us by the local card issuer for\nobligations arising out of local Card Members’ spending outside such country and for the payment by Card Members who are billed in a currency other than their\nlocal currency. Substantial and sudden devaluation of local Card Members’ currency can also affect their ability to make payments to the local issuer of the card in\nconnection with spending outside the local country. The occurrence of any of these circumstances could further impact our results of operations.\nAn inability to accept or maintain deposits due to market demand or regulatory constraints could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our\nability to fund our business.\nOur U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB, accepts deposits directly from consumers, as well as from individuals through third-party brokerage networks, and uses the\nproceeds as a source of funding. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $86 billion in total U.S. retail deposits, a portion of which had been raised\nthrough third-party brokerage networks. We face strong and increasing competition with regard to deposits, and pricing and product changes may adversely affect\nour ability to attract and retain cost-effective deposit balances. To the extent we offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits, our funding costs will be\nadversely impacted.\nOur ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates on deposits is also dependent on AENB’s capital levels. The FDIA’s brokered deposit\nprovisions and related FDIC rules in certain circumstances prohibit banks from accepting or renewing brokered deposits and apply other restrictions, such as a cap\non interest rates that can be paid. Additionally, our regulators can adjust applicable capital requirements at any time and have authority to place limitations on our\ndeposit businesses. An inability to attract or maintain deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our ability to fund our business.\nThe value of our investments may be adversely impacted by economic, political or market conditions.\nMarket risk includes the loss in value of portfolios and financial instruments due to adverse changes in market variables, which could negatively impact our\nfinancial condition. We held approximately $22 billion of investment securities as of December 31, 2020. In the event that actual default rates of these investment\nsecurities were to significantly change from historical patterns due to economic conditions or otherwise, it could have a material adverse impact on the value of our\ninvestment portfolio, potentially resulting in impairment charges. Defaults or economic disruptions, even in countries or territories in which we do not have\nmaterial investment exposure, conduct business or have operations, could adversely affect us",
