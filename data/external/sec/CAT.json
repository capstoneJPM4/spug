      "item1a":"The statements in this section describe the most significant risks to our business and should be considered carefully in conjunction with Part II, Item 7\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” of Part II, Item 8\n\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" to this Form 10-K. In addition, the statements in this section and other sections of this Form 10-K, including in\nPart II, Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" include “forward-looking statements” as that term is\ndefined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results. Forward-looking statements give\ncurrent expectations or forecasts of future events about the company or our outlook. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact they do not relate to\nhistorical or current facts and by the use of words such as “believe,” “expect,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “will be,” “should,” “plan,” “project,” “intend,” “could”\nand similar words or expressions.\nForward-looking statements are based on assumptions and on known risks and uncertainties. Although we believe we have been prudent in our assumptions, any or\nall of our forward-looking statements may prove to be inaccurate, and we can make no guarantees about our future performance. Should known or unknown risks\nor uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could materially differ from past results and/or those anticipated, estimated\nor projected.\nWe undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should,\nhowever, consult any subsequent disclosures we make in our filings with the SEC on Form 10-Q or Form 8-K.\nThe following is a cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business. In addition to the factors discussed\nelsewhere in this report, the following are some of the important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we believe could make our actual results differ\nmaterially from those described in any forward-looking statements. It is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and, as a result, you should not consider\nthe following factors to be a complete discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.\nOur business is highly sensitive to global and regional economic conditions and economic conditions in the industries we serve.\nOur results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions globally and regionally and in the particular industries we serve. The demand for our\nproducts and services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by lower levels of government and business\ninvestment, lower levels of business confidence, lower corporate earnings, perceived or actual industry overcapacity, higher unemployment and lower consumer\nspending. A prolonged period of slow growth may also reduce demand for our products and services. Economic conditions vary across regions and countries, and\ndemand for our products and services generally increases in those regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment. A change in the global\nmix of regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nThe energy and mining industries are major users of our products, including the coal, iron ore, gold, copper, oil and natural gas industries. Decisions to purchase\nour products are dependent upon the performance of these industries, which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices. Prices of commodities in these\nindustries are frequently volatile and can change abruptly and unpredictibly in response to general economic conditions, economic growth, government actions,\nregulatory actions, commodity inventories, production levels, market expectations and any disruptions in production or distribution. We assume certain prices for\nkey commodities in preparing our general economic and financial outlooks (outlooks). Commodity prices lower than those assumed in our outlooks may\nnegatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Economic conditions affecting the industries we serve may in the future also lead to\nreduced capital expenditures by our customers. Reduced capital expenditures by our customers are likely to lead to a decrease in the demand for our products and\nmay also result in a decrease in demand for aftermarket parts as customers are likely to extend preventative maintenance schedules and delay major overhauls when\npossible.\nThe rates of infrastructure spending, housing starts and commercial construction also play a significant role in our results. Our products are an integral component\nof these activities, and as these activities decrease, demand for our products may be significantly impacted, which could negatively impact our results. Slower rates\nof economic growth than anticipated in our outlooks could also adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n9\nChanges in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results . Most countries where our products and services are sold have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities, generally\nby adjusting interest rates. Interest rate changes affect overall economic growth, which affects demand for residential and nonresidential structures, as well as\nenergy and mined products, which in turn affects sales of our products and services that serve these activities. Interest rate changes also affect our customers’\nability to finance machine purchases, can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production\nof parts and components necessary to manufacture and support our products. Our outlooks typically include assumptions about interest rates in a number of\ncountries. Increases in interest rates could negatively impact sales and create supply chain inefficiencies.\nCentral banks and other policy arms of many countries take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available in an economy. Liquidity and credit\npolicies different from those assumed in our outlooks could impact the customers and markets we serve or our suppliers, which could adversely impact our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in monetary and fiscal policies, along with other factors, may cause currency exchange rates to fluctuate. Actions that lead the currency exchange rate of a\ncountry where we manufacture products to increase relative to other currencies could reduce the competitiveness of products made in that country, which could\nadversely affect our competitive position, results of operations and financial condition.\nGovernment policies on taxes and spending also affect our business. Throughout the world, government spending finances a significant portion of infrastructure\ndevelopment, such as highways, airports, sewer and water systems and dams. Tax regulations determine depreciation lives and the amount of money users of our\nproducts can retain, both of which influence investment decisions. Unfavorable developments, such as declines in government revenues, decisions to reduce public\nspending or increases in taxes, could negatively impact our results.\nCommodity price changes, component price increases, fluctuations in demand for our products or significant shortages of component products may adversely\nimpact our financial results or our ability to meet commitments to customers.\nWe are a significant user of steel and many other commodities required for the manufacture of our products. Unanticipated increases in the prices of such\ncommodities would increase our costs, negatively impacting our business, results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to fully offset the effect of\nthese increased costs through price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction programs.\nWe rely on suppliers to secure component products, particularly steel, required for the manufacture of our products. A disruption in deliveries to or from suppliers\nor decreased availability of components or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our\noperating costs. On the other hand, if demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience excess inventories and be forced to incur additional\ncharges and our profitability may suffer. Our business, competitive position, results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted if supply is\ninsufficient for our operations, if we experience excess inventories or if we are unable to adjust our production schedules or our purchases from suppliers to reflect\nchanges in customer demand and market fluctuations on a timely basis.\nDisruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit our sources of liquidity, or the liquidity of our customers, dealers and suppliers.\nGlobal economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. Although we have generated funds from our operations to pay\nour operating expenses, fund our capital expenditures and support growth, fund our employee retirement benefit programs, pay dividends and buy back stock,\ncontinuing to meet these cash requirements over the long-term requires substantial liquidity and access to varied sources of funds, including capital and credit\nmarkets. Changes in global economic conditions, including material cost increases and decreases in economic activity in the markets that we serve, and the success\nof plans to manage cost increases, inventory and other important elements of our business may significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations.\nMarket volatility, changes in counterparty credit risk, the impact of government intervention in financial markets and general economic conditions may also\nadversely impact our ability to access capital and credit markets to fund operating needs. Global or regional economic downturns could cause financial markets to\ndecrease the availability of liquidity, credit and credit capacity for certain issuers, including certain of our customers, dealers and suppliers. An inability to access\ncapital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.\n10\nIn addition, demand for our products generally depends on customers’ ability to pay for our products, which, in turn, depends on their access to funds. Subject to\nglobal economic conditions, customers may experience increased difficulty in generating funds from operations. Capital and credit market volatility and\nuncertainty may cause financial institutions to revise their lending standards, resulting in decreased access to capital. If capital and credit market volatility occurs,\ncustomers’ liquidity may decline which, in turn, would reduce their ability to purchase our products.\nOur global operations are exposed to political and economic risks, commercial instability and events beyond our control in the countries in which we operate.\nOur global operations are dependent upon products manufactured, purchased and sold in the U.S. and internationally, including in countries with political and\neconomic instability. Some countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than others.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by adverse fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the\ntransportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products. Operating and seeking to expand business in a number\nof different regions and countries exposes us to a number of risks, including: • multiple and potentially conflicting laws, regulations and policies that are subject to change; • imposition of currency restrictions, restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other restraints; • imposition of burdensome tariffs or quotas; • imposition of new or additional trade and economic sanctions laws imposed by the U.S. or foreign governments; • national and international conflict; • war or terrorist acts; and\n• political and economic instability or civil unrest that may severely disrupt economic activity in affected countries.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to maintain our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and\naccess to capital markets.\nEach of Caterpillar’s and Cat Financial’s costs of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the\nshort- and long-term debt ratings assigned to their respective debt by the major credit rating agencies. These ratings are based, in significant part, on each of\nCaterpillar’s and Cat Financial’s performance as measured by financial metrics such as net worth and interest coverage and leverage ratios, as well as transparency\nwith rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. There can be no assurance that Caterpillar or Cat Financial will be able to maintain their credit ratings\nand the failure of either Caterpillar or Cat Financial to do so could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and access to the capital\nmarkets, including restricting, in whole or in part, our access to the commercial paper market. There can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will\ncontinue to be a reliable source of short-term financing for Cat Financial or an available source of short-term financing for Caterpillar. An inability to access the\ncapital markets could have an adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur Financial Products segment is subject to risks associated with the financial services industry.\nCat Financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support to a significant share of our global sales. The inability of Cat Financial to access funds\nto support its financing activities to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nContinuing to meet Cat Financial's cash requirements over the long-term could require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds, including capital and\ncredit markets. Cat Financial has continued to maintain access to key global medium term note and commercial paper markets, but there can be no assurance that\nsuch markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing. If global economic conditions were to deteriorate, Cat Financial could face materially higher\nfinancing costs, become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow its business and/or meet its debt service obligations as they mature, and be required\nto draw upon contractually committed lending agreements and/or by seeking other funding\n11\nsources. However, there can be no assurance that such agreements and other funding sources would be available or sufficient under extreme market conditions.\nAny of these events could negatively impact Cat Financial’s business, as well as our and Cat Financial's results of operations and financial condition.\nMarket disruption and volatility may also lead to a number of other risks in connection with these events, including but not limited to: • Market developments that may affect customer confidence levels and cause declines in the demand for financing and adverse changes in payment\npatterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could impact Cat Financial’s write-offs and provision for credit losses. • The process Cat Financial uses to estimate losses inherent in its credit exposure requires a high degree of management’s judgment regarding numerous\nsubjective qualitative factors, including forecasts of economic conditions and how economic predictors might impair the ability of its borrowers to repay\ntheir loans. Financial market disruption and volatility may impact the accuracy of these judgments. • Cat Financial’s ability to engage in routine funding transactions or borrow from other financial institutions on acceptable terms or at all could be adversely\naffected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations. • As Cat Financial’s counterparties are primarily financial institutions, their ability to perform in accordance with any of its underlying agreements could be\nadversely affected by market volatility and/or disruptions in financial markets.\nChanges in interest rates or market liquidity conditions could adversely affect Cat Financial's and our earnings and/or cash flow.\nChanges in interest rates and market liquidity conditions could have an adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows. Because a significant\nnumber of the loans made by Cat Financial are made at fixed interest rates, its business is subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Changes in market interest rates\nmay influence its financing costs, returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce its and our earnings and cash flows.\nAlthough Cat Financial manages interest rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques, including a match funding program, the selective use of\nderivatives and a broadly diversified funding program, there can be no assurance that fluctuations in interest rates and market liquidity conditions will not have an\nadverse effect on its and our earnings and cash flows. If any of the variety of instruments and strategies Cat Financial uses to hedge its exposure to these types of\nrisk is ineffective, we may incur losses. With respect to Insurance Services' investment activities, changes in the equity and bond markets could cause an\nimpairment of the value of its investment portfolio, requiring a negative adjustment to earnings.\nAn increase in delinquencies, repossessions or net losses of Cat Financial customers could adversely affect its results.\nInherent in the operation of Cat Financial is the credit risk associated with its customers. The creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies,\nrepossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors, including relevant industry and economic conditions, the availability\nof capital, the experience and expertise of the customer's management team, commodity prices, political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral.\nAny increase in delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations could have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and\ncash flows. In addition, although Cat Financial evaluates and adjusts its allowance for credit losses related to past due and non-performing receivables on a regular\nbasis, adverse economic conditions or other factors that might cause deterioration of the financial health of its customers could change the timing and level of\npayments received and thus necessitate an increase in Cat Financial's estimated losses, which could also have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our\nearnings and cash flows.\nNew regulations or changes in financial services regulation could adversely impact Caterpillar and Cat Financial.\nCat Financial’s operations are highly regulated by governmental authorities in the locations where it operates, which can impose significant additional costs and/or\nrestrictions on its business. In the U.S., for example, certain of Cat Financial’s activities are subject to the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act (Dodd-Frank), a comprehensive financial reform act signed into law in July 2010 that includes extensive provisions regulating the financial services\nindustry. As such, Cat Financial has become and could continue to become subject to additional regulatory costs that could be significant and have an adverse\neffect on Cat Financial's and our results of operations and financial condition. Additional regulations in\n12\nthe U.S. or internationally impacting the financial services industry could also add significant cost or operational constraints that might have an adverse effect on\nCat Financial's and our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures, or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected.\nIn pursuing our business strategy, we routinely evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures. We often\ncompete with others for the same opportunities. To be successful, we conduct due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies, negotiate\ntransaction terms, complete complex transactions and manage post-closing matters such as the integration of acquired businesses. Our due diligence reviews are\nsubject to the completeness and accuracy of disclosures made by third parties. We may incur unanticipated costs or expenses following a completed acquisition,\nincluding post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation, and other liabilities.\nThe risks associated with our past or future acquisitions also include the following: • the business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture; • technological and product synergies, economies of scale and cost reductions may not occur as expected; • unforeseen expenses, delays or conditions may be imposed upon the acquisition, including due to required regulatory approvals or consents; • we may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities or be subject to unexpected penalties or other enforcement actions; • faulty assumptions may be made regarding the integration process; • unforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating operations, processes and systems; • higher than expected investments may be required to implement necessary compliance processes and related systems, including IT systems, accounting\nsystems and internal controls over financial reporting; • we may fail to retain, motivate and integrate key management and other employees of the acquired business; • higher than expected costs may arise due to unforeseen changes in tax, trade, environmental, labor, safety, payroll or pension policies in any jurisdiction in\nwhich the acquired business conducts its operations; and\n• we may experience problems in retaining customers and integrating customer bases.\nMany of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and\ndiversion of management’s time and attention. They may also delay the realization of the benefits we anticipate when we enter into a transaction.\nIn order to conserve cash for operations, we may undertake acquisitions financed in part through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities,\nor other arrangements. Such acquisition financing could result in a decrease in our earnings and adversely affect other leverage measures. If we issue equity\nsecurities or equity-linked securities, the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares.\nFailure to implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations. Furthermore, we make strategic divestitures from time to time. In the case of divestitures, we may agree to indemnify\nacquiring parties for certain liabilities arising from our former businesses. These divestitures may also result in continued financial involvement in the divested\nbusinesses, including through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Lower performance by those divested businesses could affect\nour future financial results.\n13\nInternational trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position.\nGovernment policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas, capital controls or tariffs, whether adopted by individual governments or\naddressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being\nable to sell products in certain countries. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs or new barriers to\nentry, in countries where we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. For\nexample, a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results\nof operations.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to develop, produce and market quality products that meet our customers’ needs.\nOur business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to our\ndealers, OEMs and end-user customers. This is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to maintain key dealer relationships, our ability to produce\nproducts that meet the quality, performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs.\nIn addition, our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on leading-edge innovation, with respect to both products and\noperations, and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovation. Failure to continue to deliver high quality, innovative, competitive\nproducts to the marketplace, to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements, including\nengine exhaust emission requirements or to predict market demands for, or gain market acceptance of, our products, could have a negative impact on our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment, which could adversely affect our sales and pricing.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment, and our outlook depends on a forecast of our share of industry sales based on our ability to compete with others in\nthe marketplace. We compete on the basis of a variety of factors, including product performance, customer service, quality and price. There can be no assurance\nthat our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies’ products. Thus, our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing\nor product strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties, our failure to price our products competitively, our failure to\nproduce our products at a competitive cost or an unexpected buildup in competitors’ new machine or dealer-owned rental fleets, leading to severe downward\npressure on machine rental rates and/or used equipment prices.\nOur sales outlook assumes that certain price increases we announce from time to time will be realized in the marketplace. Changes in market acceptance of price\nincreases, changes in market requirements for price discounts, changes in our competitors’ behavior or a weak pricing environment attributable to industry\novercapacity could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, our results and ability to compete may be impacted negatively by changes in our sales mix. Our outlook assumes a certain geographic mix of sales as\nwell as a certain product mix of sales. If actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales, our results could be negatively impacted.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from cost-reduction initiatives, cash flow improvement initiatives and efficiency or productivity initiatives.\nWe are actively engaged in a number of initiatives to increase our productivity, efficiency and cash flow and to reduce costs, which we expect to have a positive\neffect on our business, competitive position, results of operations and financial condition. For example, we formed the Caterpillar Enterprise System Group in 2013\nto implement sustained improvements in our operational efficiency and order-to-delivery processes so that our lead time is better aligned with customer\nrequirements, as well as to reduce waste, further enhance quality and maximize value for our customers. We are also in the process of implementing new\nenterprise resource planning (ERP) systems in many of our businesses to increase efficiency and harmonize our operations. There can be no assurance that these\nERP systems, these initiatives, or others will continue to be beneficial to the extent anticipated, or that the estimated efficiency improvements, incremental cost\nsavings or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all. If our new ERP systems are not implemented successfully, it could have an adverse\neffect on our operations and competitive position.\n14\nWe expect to incur additional restructuring charges as we continue to contemplate cost reduction actions in an effort to optimize our cost structure and may\nnot achieve the anticipated savings and benefits of these actions.\nOn September 24, 2015, we announced significant restructuring and cost reduction actions to lower our operating costs in response to current economic and\nbusiness conditions. We expect to take additional restructuring actions through 2018 to optimize our cost structure and improve the efficiency of our operation,\nwhich will reduce our profitability in the periods incurred. As a result of these actions, we will likely continue to incur charges, which may include but not be\nlimited to asset impairments, employee termination costs, charges for pension and other postretirement contractual benefits, potential additional pension funding\nobligations, and pension curtailments, any of which could be significant, and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition,\nwe may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from past or future cost reduction actions in full or in part or within the time periods we expect. We are also\nsubject to the risks of labor unrest, negative publicity and business disruption in connection with our cost reduction actions. Failure to realize anticipated savings or\nbenefits from our cost reduction actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash\nflows.\nOur business is subject to the inventory management decisions and sourcing practices of our dealers and our OEM customers.\nWe sell finished products primarily through an independent dealer network and directly to OEMs and are subject to risks relating to their inventory management\ndecisions and operational and sourcing practices. Both carry inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on\ntheir assessments of future needs. Such adjustments may impact our results positively or negatively. If the inventory levels of our dealers and OEM customers are\nhigher than they desire, they may postpone product purchases from us, which could cause our sales to be lower than the end-user demand for our products and\nnegatively impact our results. Similarly, our results could be negatively impacted through the loss of time-sensitive sales if our dealers and OEM customers do not\nmaintain inventory levels sufficient to meet customer demand. Additionally, some of our engine customers are OEMs that manufacture or could in the future\nmanufacture engines for their own products. Despite their engine manufacturing abilities, these customers have chosen to outsource certain types of engine\nproduction to us due to the quality of our engine products and in order to reduce costs, eliminate production risks and maintain company focus. However, there can\nbe no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource engine manufacture in the future. Decreased levels of production outsourcing by these customers\ncould result from a number of factors, such as shifts in our customers’ business strategies, acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer, the inability\nof third-party suppliers to meet specifications and the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in foreign countries. A significant reduction in the level of\nengine production outsourcing from our OEM customers could significantly impact our revenues and, accordingly, have an adverse effect on our business, results\nof operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs.\nOur facilities, operations and products are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations globally, including laws and regulations governing\nemissions to noise, air, discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous waste\nmaterials. Some environmental laws impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous substances, even for\nconduct that was lawful at the time it occurred, or for the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators, predecessors or other third parties. Failure to comply\nwith environmental laws could expose us to penalties or clean-up costs, civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our activities, as well as damage to\nproperty or natural resources. These liabilities, sanctions, damages and remediation efforts related to any non-compliance with such laws and regulations could\nnegatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there can be no assurances that we will not\nbe adversely affected by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that\nmay be adopted or imposed in the future.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations may also change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. Changes in environmental laws or\nregulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to environmental laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our\noperations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations,\nincluding laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance\nexpenditures. Changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs\nand restrictions, including increased energy and raw materials costs. If environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant\noperational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products, they could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, results of\noperations, financial condition and competitive position.\n15\nOur global operations are subject to extensive trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations.\nDue to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations\nissued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Antiboycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls\nand the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries. Any alleged or actual violations may subject us to\ngovernment scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the\nUnited States. Furthermore, embargoes and sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries or\nbased on product classification expose us to potential criminal and civil sanctions. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to\nwhich our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nIn addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making\nimproper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or\nobtaining an unfair advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Our operations outside the United\nStates, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations. In addition, we enter into joint ventures with joint venture partners who are\ndomiciled in areas of the world with laws, regulations and business practices that differ from those in the United States. There is risk that our joint venture partners\nwill violate applicable laws and regulations. Violations of anti-corruption laws or regulations by our employees, by intermediaries acting on our behalf, or by our\njoint venture partners may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and\nresults of operations or financial condition.\nWe may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the\nlocation of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result\nof a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our overall profitability, changes in tax laws or treaties or in their\napplication or interpretation, changes in tax rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and\nliabilities, changes in the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing\nassessments of our tax exposures. We are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax\nauthorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations. If our effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate\ndetermination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be\nadversely affected. For information regarding additional legal matters related to our taxes, please see Note 5 — \"Income taxes\" and Note 22 — \"Environmental and\nlegal matters\" of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" to this Annual Report on Form 10-K . Currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations, as reported in our financial statements.\nWe conduct operations in many areas of the world, involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to currency exchange rate risk to\nthe extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. In addition, changes in currency exchange rates have had, and\nwill continue to have, an impact on our results of operations. There can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our\nresults of operations, financial condition and cash flows. While the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations\nin currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange\nrates. In addition, our outlooks do not assume fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates from the date of our\noutlooks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in our outlooks and adversely impact our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nWe also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign\ncurrencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing\ncontrols. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation.\n16\nRestrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility.\nWe maintain a number of credit facilities to support general corporate purposes (facilities) and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations\n(debt securities). The agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain of\nour subsidiaries, including Cat Financial. These covenants include maintaining a consolidated net worth (defined as the consolidated stockholder’s equity\nincluding preferred stock but excluding the pension and other post-retirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) of not less\nthan $9 billion, limitations on the incurrence of liens and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger. Cat Financial has also agreed under certain of these\nagreements to maintain a leverage ratio (consolidated debt to consolidated net worth, calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios\ndetermined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each December 31) not greater than 10.0 to 1, to maintain a minimum interest\ncoverage ratio (profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to interest expense, calculated at the end of each\ncalendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended) of not less than 1.15 to 1 and not to terminate, amend or modify its support agreement\nwith us.\nA breach of one or more of the covenants could result in adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition. These consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities, triggering of an obligation to redeem certain\ndebt securities, termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders, refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to\nenter into new facilities or the lowering or modification of our credit ratings or those of one or more of our subsidiaries.\nSustained increases in funding obligations under our pension plans may reduce our profitability.\nWe maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for our employees, which impose on us certain funding obligations. In determining our future payment\nobligations under the plans, we assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and growth rates of certain costs. Significant adverse changes in credit or capital\nmarkets could result in actual rates of return being materially lower than projected and increased pension expense in future years. We are expecting to make\ncontributions to our pension plans in the future, and may be required to make contributions that could be material. Our cost growth rates may also be materially\nhigher than projected. These factors could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans, and as a result, adversely affect our business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nUnion disputes or other labor matters could adversely affect our operations and financial results . Some of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and\nexpiration dates. There can be no assurance that any current or future issues with our employees will be resolved or that we will not encounter future strikes, work\nstoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees. We may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the\nUnited States and other countries when they expire. If we fail to renegotiate our existing collective bargaining agreements, we could encounter strikes or work\nstoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at our\nfacilities in the future. We may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements. A work\nstoppage or other limitations on production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition. In addition, many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces. Strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers\ncould have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCosts associated with lawsuits or investigations or adverse rulings in enforcement or other legal proceedings may have an adverse effect on our results of\noperations.\nWe are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in virtually every part of the world. We face an inherent business risk of exposure to\nvarious types of claims, lawsuits and government investigations. We are involved in various intellectual property, product liability, product warranty and\nenvironmental claims and lawsuits and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business. The industries in which we operate\nare also periodically reviewed or investigated by regulators, which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation\nclaims. It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims, investigations and lawsuits, and we could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties\nor enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition in any particular\nperiod.\n17\nThe global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other\ncontingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, will arise from time to time. In addition, subsequent developments in legal proceedings\nmay affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have\nan adverse effect on our results of operations.\nChanges in accounting guidance could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, as reported in our financial statements.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP),\nwhich is periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting guidance and related\ninterpretations issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC. The impact of accounting\npronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in this annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. An\nassessment of proposed standards is not provided, as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and, therefore, their effects on our financial\nstatements cannot be meaningfully assessed. It is possible that future accounting guidance we are required to adopt, or future changes in accounting principles,\ncould change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have an adverse effect on our\nresults of operations, as reported in our consolidated financial statements.\nIncreased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services.\nWe rely upon information technology systems and networks, some of which are managed by third parties, in connection with a variety of business activities.\nAdditionally, we collect and store data that is sensitive to Caterpillar. Operating these information technology systems and networks and processing and\nmaintaining this data, in a secure manner, are critical to our business operations and strategy. Information technology security threats -- from user error to\ncybersecurity attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems, networks and data -- are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Cybersecurity\nattacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crime and advanced threats. These threats pose a\nrisk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. We have experienced cybersecurity attacks that have\nresulted in unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and networks, and we could in the future experience similar attacks.\nHowever, to date, no cybersecurity attack has had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. While we actively manage\ninformation technology security risks within our control, there can be no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to mitigate all potential risks to our systems,\nnetworks and data. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity attack include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, diminution in the value\nof our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our\ncompetitiveness and results of operations.\nUnexpected events, including natural disasters, may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations.\nThe occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including war, terrorist acts, fires, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and other forms of severe\nweather in the United States or in other countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial\nperformance. Natural disasters, pandemic illness, equipment failures, power outages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or\npartial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of component products from\nsome local and international suppliers, disruption in the transport of our products to dealers and end-users and delay in the delivery of our products to our\ndistribution centers. Existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events.",

      "item1a":"The statements in this section describe the most significant risks to our business and should be considered carefully in conjunction with Part II, Item 7\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” of Part II, Item 8\n\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" to this Form 10-K. In addition, the statements in this section and other sections of this Form 10-K, including in\nPart II, Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" include “forward-looking statements” as that term is\ndefined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results. Forward-looking statements give\ncurrent expectations or forecasts of future events about the company or our outlook. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact they do not relate to\nhistorical or current facts and by the use of words such as “believe,” “expect,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “will be,” “should,” “plan,” “project,” “intend,” “could”\nand similar words or expressions.\nForward-looking statements are based on assumptions and on known risks and uncertainties. Although we believe we have been prudent in our assumptions, any or\nall of our forward-looking statements may prove to be inaccurate, and we can make no guarantees about our future performance. Should known or unknown risks\nor uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could materially differ from past results and/or those anticipated, estimated\nor projected.\nWe undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should,\nhowever, consult any subsequent disclosures we make in our filings with the SEC on Form 10-Q or Form 8-K.\nThe following is a cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business. In addition to the factors discussed\nelsewhere in this report, the following are some of the important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we believe could make our actual results differ\nmaterially from those described in any forward-looking statements. It is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and, as a result, you should not consider\nthe following factors to be a complete discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.\nMACROECONOMIC RISKS\nOur business is highly sensitive to global and regional economic conditions and economic conditions in the industries we serve.\nOur results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions globally and regionally and in the particular industries we serve. The demand for our\nproducts and services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in periods of economic weakness characterized by lower levels of government and\nbusiness investment, lower levels of business confidence, lower corporate earnings, perceived or actual industry overcapacity, higher unemployment and lower\nconsumer spending. A prolonged period of economic weakness may also result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential\ngoodwill and asset impairment charges. Economic conditions vary across regions and countries, and demand for our products and services generally increases in\nthose regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment. Slower economic growth or a change in the global mix of regions and countries\nexperiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe energy, transportation and mining industries are major users of our products, including the coal, iron ore, gold, copper, oil and natural gas industries.\nCustomers in these industries frequently base their decisions to purchase our products on the expected future performance of these industries, which in turn are\ndependent in part on commodity prices. Prices of commodities in these industries are frequently volatile and can change abruptly and unpredictibly in response to\ngeneral economic conditions and trends, government actions, regulatory actions, commodity inventories, production levels, market expectations and any\ndisruptions in production or distribution. Economic conditions affecting the industries we serve may in the future also lead to reduced capital expenditures by our\ncustomers. Reduced capital expenditures by our customers are likely to lead to a decrease in the demand for our products and may also result in a decrease in\ndemand for aftermarket parts as customers are likely to extend preventative maintenance schedules and delay major overhauls when possible.\nThe rates of infrastructure spending, housing starts and commercial construction also play a significant role in our results. Our products are an integral component\nof these activities, and as these activities decrease, demand for our products may be significantly impacted, which could negatively impact our results.\n9\nTable of Contents\nCommodity price changes, material price increases, fluctuations in demand for our products or significant shortages of material may adversely impact\nour financial results or our ability to meet commitments to customers.\nWe are a significant user of steel and many other commodities required for the manufacture of our products. Increases in the prices of such commodities would\nincrease our costs, negatively impacting our business, results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to fully offset the effect of these increased costs\nthrough price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction programs.\nWe rely on suppliers to secure material, particularly steel, required for the manufacture of our products. A disruption in deliveries to or from suppliers or decreased\navailability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. On\nthe other hand, if demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience excess inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our\nprofitability may suffer. Our business, competitive position, results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted if supply is insufficient for\nour operations, if we experience excess inventories or if we are unable to adjust our production schedules or our purchases from suppliers to reflect changes in\ncustomer demand and market fluctuations on a timely basis.\nChanges in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results . Most countries where our products and services are sold have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities, generally\nby adjusting interest rates. Interest rate changes affect overall economic growth, which affects demand for residential and nonresidential structures, as well as\nenergy and mined products, which in turn affects sales of our products and services that serve these activities. Interest rate changes may also affect our customers’\nability to finance machine purchases, can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production\nof parts and components necessary to manufacture and support our products. Increases in interest rates could negatively impact sales and create supply chain\ninefficiencies.\nCentral banks and other policy arms of many countries take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available in an economy. The impact from a change\nin liquidity and credit policies could impact the customers and markets we serve or our suppliers, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations\nand financial condition.\nChanges in monetary and fiscal policies, along with other factors, may cause currency exchange rates to fluctuate. Actions that lead the currency exchange rate of a\ncountry where we manufacture products to increase relative to other currencies could reduce the competitiveness of products made in that country, which could\nadversely affect our competitive position, results of operations and financial condition.\nGovernment policies on taxes and spending also affect our business. Throughout the world, government spending finances a significant portion of infrastructure\ndevelopment, such as highways, airports, sewer and water systems and dams. Tax regulations determine depreciation lives and the amount of money users of our\nproducts can retain, both of which influence investment decisions. Unfavorable developments, such as declines in government revenues, decisions to reduce public\nspending or increases in taxes, could negatively impact our results.\nOur global operations are exposed to political and economic risks, commercial instability and events beyond our control in the countries in which we\noperate.\nOur global operations are dependent upon products manufactured, purchased and sold in the U.S. and internationally, including in countries with political and\neconomic instability or uncertainty. This includes, for example, the uncertainty related to the United Kingdom’s June 2016 vote to leave the European Union\n(commonly known as “Brexit”). Some countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than\nothers. Our business could be negatively impacted by adverse fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in\nthe transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products. Operating in a number of different regions and\ncountries exposes us to a number of risks, including: • multiple and potentially conflicting laws, regulations and policies that are subject to change; • imposition of currency restrictions, restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other restraints; • imposition of burdensome tariffs or quotas; • changes in trade agreements;\n10\nTable of Contents\n• imposition of new or additional trade and economic sanctions laws imposed by the U.S. or foreign governments; • war or terrorist acts; and\n• political and economic instability or civil unrest that may severely disrupt economic activity in affected countries.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n OPERATIONAL RISKS\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to develop, produce and market quality products that meet our customers’ needs.\nOur business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to our\ndealers, OEMs and end-user customers. This is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to maintain key dealer relationships, our ability to produce\nproducts that meet the quality, performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs.\nIn addition, our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on leading-edge innovation, with respect to both products and\noperations, and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovation. Failure to continue to deliver high quality, innovative, competitive\nproducts to the marketplace, to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements, including\nengine exhaust emission requirements or to predict market demands for, or gain market acceptance of, our products, could have a negative impact on our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment, which could adversely affect our sales and pricing.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. We compete on the basis of a variety of factors, including product performance, customer service, quality and\nprice. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies’ products. Thus, our share of industry sales could be\nreduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties, our failure to price our\nproducts competitively, our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or an unexpected buildup in competitors’ new machine or dealer-owned rental\nfleets, leading to severe downward pressure on machine rental rates and/or used equipment prices.\nLack of customer acceptance of price increases we announce from time to time, changes in customer requirements for price discounts, changes in our customers’\nbehavior or a weak pricing environment attributable to industry overcapacity could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nIn addition, our results and ability to compete may be impacted negatively by changes in our geographic and product mix of sales.\nIncreased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services.\nWe rely upon information technology systems and networks, some of which are managed by third parties, in connection with a variety of business activities.\nAdditionally, we collect and store data that is sensitive to Caterpillar. Operating these information technology systems and networks and processing and\nmaintaining this data, in a secure manner, are critical to our business operations and strategy. Information technology security threats -- from user error to\ncybersecurity attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems, networks and data -- are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Cybersecurity\nattacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crime and advanced threats. These threats pose a\nrisk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Cybersecurity attacks could also include attacks\ntargeting the security, integrity and/or reliability of the hardware and software installed in our products. We have experienced cybersecurity attacks that have\nresulted in unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and networks, and we could in the future experience similar attacks.\nHowever, to date, no cybersecurity attack has had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. While we actively manage\ninformation technology security risks within our control, there can be no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to mitigate all potential risks to our systems,\nnetworks and data. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity attack include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, disruption to systems,\nunauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, corruption of data, diminution in the value of our investment in research,\n11\nTable of Contents\ndevelopment and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of\noperations.\nWe expect to incur additional restructuring charges as we continue to contemplate cost reduction actions in an effort to optimize our cost structure and\nmay not achieve the anticipated savings and benefits of these actions.\nOn September 24, 2015, we announced significant restructuring and cost reduction actions expected to occur through 2018 to lower our operating costs in response\nto current economic and business conditions. We expect to take additional restructuring actions to optimize our cost structure and improve the efficiency of our\noperation, which will reduce our profitability in the periods incurred. As a result of these actions, we will incur charges, which may include but not be limited to\nasset impairments, employee termination costs, charges for pension and other postretirement contractual benefits, potential additional pension funding obligations,\nand pension curtailments, any of which could be significant, and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may not\nrealize anticipated savings or benefits from past or future cost reduction actions in full or in part or within the time periods we expect. We are also subject to the\nrisks of labor unrest, negative publicity and business disruption in connection with our cost reduction actions. Failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from\nour cost reduction actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from cost-reduction initiatives, cash flow improvement initiatives and efficiency or productivity\ninitiatives.\nWe are actively engaged in a number of initiatives to increase our productivity, efficiency and cash flow and to reduce costs, which we expect to have a positive\nlong-term effect on our business, competitive position, results of operations and financial condition. For example, one such initiative is to implement sustained\nimprovements in our operational efficiency and order-to-delivery processes so that our lead time is better aligned with customer requirements, as well as to reduce\nwaste, further enhance quality and maximize value for our customers. There can be no assurance that these initiatives or others will continue to be beneficial to\nthe extent anticipated, or that the estimated efficiency improvements, incremental cost savings or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all.\nIf these initiatives are not implemented successfully, it could have an adverse effect on our operations and competitive position.\nOur business is subject to the inventory management decisions and sourcing practices of our dealers and our OEM customers.\nWe sell finished products primarily through an independent dealer network and directly to OEMs and are subject to risks relating to their inventory management\ndecisions and operational and sourcing practices. Both carry inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on\ntheir assessments of future needs and market conditions, including levels of used equipment inventory. Such adjustments may impact our results positively or\nnegatively. If the inventory levels of our dealers and OEM customers are higher than they desire, they may postpone product purchases from us, which could cause\nour sales to be lower than the end-user demand for our products and negatively impact our results. Similarly, our results could be negatively impacted through the\nloss of time-sensitive sales if our dealers and OEM customers do not maintain inventory levels sufficient to meet customer demand.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures, or these benefits may take longer to realize than\nexpected.\nIn pursuing our business strategy, we routinely evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures. We often\ncompete with others for the same opportunities. To be successful, we conduct due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies, negotiate\ntransaction terms, complete complex transactions and manage post-closing matters such as the integration of acquired businesses. Further, while we seek to\nmitigate risks and liabilities of such transactions through, among other things, due diligence, there may be risks and liabilities that such due diligence efforts fail to\ndiscover, that are not accurately or completely disclosed to us or that we inadequately assess. We may incur unanticipated costs or expenses following a completed\nacquisition, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation, and other liabilities. Risks\nassociated with our past or future acquisitions also include the following: • the business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture; • technological and product synergies, economies of scale and cost reductions may not occur as expected;\n12\nTable of Contents\n• unforeseen expenses, delays or conditions may be imposed upon the acquisition, including due to required regulatory approvals or consents; • we may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities or be subject to unexpected penalties or other enforcement actions; • faulty assumptions may be made regarding the macroeconomic environment or the integration process; • unforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating operations, processes and systems; • higher than expected investments may be required to implement necessary compliance processes and related systems, including IT systems, accounting\nsystems and internal controls over financial reporting; • we may fail to retain, motivate and integrate key management and other employees of the acquired business; • higher than expected costs may arise due to unforeseen changes in tax, trade, environmental, labor, safety, payroll or pension policies in any jurisdiction in\nwhich the acquired business conducts its operations; and\n• we may experience problems in retaining customers and integrating customer bases.\nMany of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and\ndiversion of management’s time and attention. They may also delay the realization of the benefits we anticipate when we enter into a transaction.\nIn order to conserve cash for operations, we may undertake acquisitions financed in part through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities,\nor other arrangements. Such acquisition financing could result in a decrease in our earnings and adversely affect other leverage measures. If we issue equity\nsecurities or equity-linked securities, the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares.\nFailure to implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations. Furthermore, we make strategic divestitures from time to time. In the case of divestitures, we may agree to indemnify\nacquiring parties for certain liabilities arising from our former businesses. These divestitures may also result in continued financial involvement in the divested\nbusinesses, including through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Lower performance by those divested businesses could affect\nour future financial results.\nUnion disputes or other labor matters could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nSome of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and\nexpiration dates. There can be no assurance that any current or future issues with our employees will be resolved or that we will not encounter future strikes, work\nstoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees. We may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the\nUnited States and other countries when they expire. If we fail to renegotiate our existing collective bargaining agreements, we could encounter strikes or work\nstoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at our\nfacilities in the future. We may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements. A work\nstoppage or other limitations on production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition. In addition, many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces. Strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers\ncould have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nUnexpected events, including natural disasters, may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations.\nThe occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including war, terrorist acts, fires, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and other forms of severe\nweather in the United States or in other countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial\nperformance. Natural disasters, pandemic illness, equipment failures, power outages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or\npartial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of component products from\nsome local and international suppliers, disruption in the transport of our products to dealers and end-users and delay in the delivery of our products to our\ndistribution centers. Existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events.\n13\nTable of Contents\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nDisruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit our sources of liquidity, or the liquidity of our customers, dealers and suppliers.\nContinuing to meet our cash requirements over the long-term requires substantial liquidity and access to varied sources of funds, including capital and credit\nmarkets. Global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. Market volatility, changes in counterparty credit risk,\nthe impact of government intervention in financial markets and general economic conditions may also adversely impact our ability to access capital and credit\nmarkets to fund operating needs. Global or regional economic downturns could cause financial markets to decrease the availability of liquidity, credit and credit\ncapacity for certain issuers, including certain of our customers, dealers and suppliers. An inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect\non our business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position. Furthermore, changes in global economic conditions, including material cost\nincreases and decreases in economic activity in key markets we serve, and the success of plans to manage cost increases, inventory and other important elements of\nour business may significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations.\nIn addition, demand for our products generally depends on customers’ ability to pay for our products, which, in turn, depends on their access to funds. Changes in\nglobal economic conditions may result in customers experiencing increased difficulty in generating funds from operations and capital and credit market volatility\nand uncertainty may cause financial institutions to revise their lending standards, resulting in customers’ decreased access to capital. If capital and credit market\nvolatility occurs, customers’ liquidity may decline which, in turn, would reduce their ability to purchase our products.\nFailure to maintain our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position\nand access to capital markets.\nEach of Caterpillar’s and Cat Financial’s costs of borrowing and their respective ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but\nalso by the short- and long-term debt ratings assigned to their respective debt by the major credit rating agencies. These ratings are based, in significant part, on\neach of Caterpillar’s and Cat Financial’s performance as measured by financial metrics such as net worth, interest coverage and leverage ratios, as well as\ntransparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. There can be no assurance that Caterpillar or Cat Financial will be able to maintain their\ncredit ratings. On December 13, 2016, Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) downgraded the long- and short-term ratings of Caterpillar and Cat Financial to A3\nfrom A2 and to Prime-2 from Prime-1. A further downgrade of Caterpillar or Cat Financial’s credit ratings by Moody’s or one of the other major credit rating\nagencies could adversely affect Caterpillar’s and Cat Financial’s cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and access to the capital markets, including\nrestricting, in whole or in part, access to the commercial paper market. There can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will continue to be a reliable\nsource of short-term financing for Cat Financial or an available source of short-term financing for Caterpillar. An inability to access the capital markets could have\nan adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur Financial Products segment is subject to risks associated with the financial services industry.\nCat Financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support to a significant share of our global sales. The inability of Cat Financial to access funds\nto support its financing activities to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nContinuing to meet Cat Financial's cash requirements over the long-term could require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds, including capital and\ncredit markets. Cat Financial has continued to maintain access to key global medium term note and commercial paper markets, but there can be no assurance that\nsuch markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing. If global economic conditions were to deteriorate, Cat Financial could face materially higher\nfinancing costs, become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow its business and/or meet its debt service obligations as they mature, and be required\nto draw upon contractually committed lending agreements and/or seek other funding sources. However, there can be no assurance that such agreements and other\nfunding sources would be available or sufficient under extreme market conditions. Any of these events could negatively impact Cat Financial’s business, as well as\nour and Cat Financial's results of operations and financial condition.\nMarket disruption and volatility may also lead to a number of other risks in connection with these events, including but not limited to:\n14\nTable of Contents\n• Market developments that may affect customer confidence levels and cause declines in the demand for financing and adverse changes in payment\npatterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could impact Cat Financial’s write-offs and provision for credit losses. • The process Cat Financial uses to estimate losses inherent in its credit exposure requires a high degree of management’s judgment regarding numerous\nsubjective qualitative factors, including forecasts of economic conditions and how economic predictors might impair the ability of its borrowers to repay\ntheir loans. Financial market disruption and volatility may impact the accuracy of these judgments. • Cat Financial’s ability to engage in routine funding transactions or borrow from other financial institutions on acceptable terms or at all could be adversely\naffected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations. • As Cat Financial’s lending agreements are primarily with financial institutions, their ability to perform in accordance with any of its underlying\nagreements could be adversely affected by market volatility and/or disruptions in financial markets.\nChanges in interest rates or market liquidity conditions could adversely affect Cat Financial's and our earnings and/or cash flow.\nChanges in interest rates and market liquidity conditions could have an adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows. Because a significant\nnumber of the loans made by Cat Financial are made at fixed interest rates, its business is subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Changes in market interest rates\nmay influence its financing costs, returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce its and our earnings and cash flows.\nAlthough Cat Financial manages interest rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques, including a match funding program, the selective use of\nderivatives and a broadly diversified funding program, there can be no assurance that fluctuations in interest rates and market liquidity conditions will not have an\nadverse effect on its and our earnings and cash flows. If any of the variety of instruments and strategies Cat Financial uses to hedge its exposure to these types of\nrisk is ineffective, we may incur losses. With respect to Insurance Services' investment activities, changes in the equity and bond markets could cause an\nimpairment of the value of its investment portfolio, requiring a negative adjustment to earnings.\nAn increase in delinquencies, repossessions or net losses of Cat Financial customers could adversely affect its results.\nInherent in the operation of Cat Financial is the credit risk associated with its customers. The creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies,\nrepossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors, including relevant industry and economic conditions, the availability\nof capital, the experience and expertise of the customer's management team, commodity prices, political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral.\nAny increase in delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations could have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and\ncash flows. In addition, although Cat Financial evaluates and adjusts its allowance for credit losses related to past due and non-performing receivables on a regular\nbasis, adverse economic conditions or other factors that might cause deterioration of the financial health of its customers could change the timing and level of\npayments received and thus necessitate an increase in Cat Financial's estimated losses, which could also have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our\nearnings and cash flows.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations, as reported in our financial statements.\nWe conduct operations in many areas of the world, involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to currency exchange rate risk to\nthe extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates have had, and will\ncontinue to have, an impact on our results as expressed in U.S. dollars. There can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect\nour results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. While the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency\nexchange rates. In addition, our outlooks do not assume fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates from the date of\nour outlooks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in our outlooks and adversely impact our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nWe also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign\ncurrencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries\n15\nTable of Contents\nor businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency\nof the country instituting the devaluation.\nRestrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility.\nWe maintain a number of credit facilities to support general corporate purposes (facilities) and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations\n(debt securities). The agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain of\nour subsidiaries, including Cat Financial. These covenants include maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth (defined as the consolidated stockholder’s\nequity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other post-retirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)),\nlimitations on the incurrence of liens and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger. Cat Financial has also agreed under certain of these agreements not to\nexceed a certain leverage ratio (consolidated debt to consolidated net worth, calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on\nthe last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each December 31), to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio (profit excluding income\ntaxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to interest expense, calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter\nperiod then most recently ended) and not to terminate, amend or modify its support agreement with us.\nA breach of one or more of the covenants could result in adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition. These consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities, triggering of an obligation to redeem certain\ndebt securities, termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders, refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to\nenter into new facilities or the lowering or modification of our credit ratings or those of one or more of our subsidiaries.\nSustained increases in funding obligations under our pension plans may impair our liquidity or financial condition.\nWe maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for our employees, which impose on us certain funding obligations. In determining our future payment\nobligations under the plans, we assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and a certain level of future benefit payments. Significant adverse changes in credit\nor capital markets could result in actual rates of return being materially lower than projected and increased contribution requirements. We are expecting to make\ncontributions to our pension plans in the future, and may be required to make contributions that could be material. We may fund contributions through the use of\ncash on hand, the proceeds of borrowings, shares of our common stock or a combination of the foregoing, as permitted by applicable law. Our assumptions for\nfuture benefit payments may also be materially higher than projected. These factors could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans, and as a\nresult, adversely affect our business and overall financial condition.\nLEGAL & REGULATORY RISKS\nOur global operations are subject to extensive trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations.\nDue to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations\nissued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Antiboycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls\nand the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries. Any alleged or actual violations may subject us to\ngovernment scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the\nUnited States. Furthermore, embargoes and sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries or\nbased on product classification expose us to potential criminal and civil sanctions. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to\nwhich our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nIn addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making\nimproper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or\nobtaining an unfair advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Our operations outside the United\nStates, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations. Violations of anti-corruption laws or regulations by our employees, by\nintermediaries acting on our behalf, or by our joint venture partners may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an\nadverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.\n16\nTable of Contents\nInternational trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position.\nGovernment policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas, capital controls or tariffs, whether adopted by individual governments or\naddressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being\nable to sell products in certain countries. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs or new barriers to\nentry, in countries where we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. For\nexample, a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results\nof operations.\nWe may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the\nlocation of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result\nof a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our overall profitability, changes in tax laws or treaties or in their\napplication or interpretation, changes in tax rates, repatriation of cash to the United States, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the\nvaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of\npreviously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures. We are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the\nU.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations. If our\neffective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating\nresults, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. For information regarding additional legal matters related to our taxes, please see Note 5 —\n\"Income taxes\" and Note 22 — \"Environmental and legal matters\" of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" to this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K . Costs associated with lawsuits or investigations or adverse rulings in enforcement or other legal proceedings may have an adverse effect on our results of\noperations.\nWe are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in virtually every part of the world. We face an inherent business risk of exposure to\nvarious types of claims, lawsuits and government investigations. We are involved in various intellectual property, product liability, product warranty and\nenvironmental claims and lawsuits and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business. The industries in which we operate\nare also periodically reviewed or investigated by regulators, which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation\nclaims. It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims, investigations and lawsuits, and we could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties\nor enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition in any particular\nperiod.\nThe global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other\ncontingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, will arise from time to time. In addition, subsequent developments in legal proceedings\nmay affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have\nan adverse effect on our results of operations.\nNew regulations or changes in financial services regulation could adversely impact Caterpillar and Cat Financial.\nCat Financial’s operations are highly regulated by governmental authorities in the locations where it operates, which can impose significant additional costs and/or\nrestrictions on its business. In the U.S., for example, certain of Cat Financial’s activities are subject to the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act (Dodd-Frank), which includes extensive provisions regulating the financial services industry. As such, Cat Financial has become and could continue\nto become subject to additional regulatory costs that could be significant and have an adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our results of operations and financial\ncondition. Additional regulations in the U.S. or internationally impacting the financial services industry could also add significant cost or operational constraints\nthat might have an adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our results of operations and financial condition.\n17\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs.\nOur facilities, operations and products are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations globally, including laws and regulations governing\nemissions to noise, air, discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous waste\nmaterials. Some environmental laws impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous substances, even for\nconduct that was lawful at the time it occurred, or for the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators, predecessors or other third parties. Failure to comply\nwith environmental laws could expose us to penalties or clean-up costs, civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our activities, as well as damage to\nproperty or natural resources. The potential liabilities, sanctions, damages and remediation efforts related to any non-compliance with such laws and regulations\ncould negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there can be no assurances that we\nwill not be adversely affected by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or\nthose that may be adopted or imposed in the future.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations may also change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. Changes in environmental laws or\nregulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to environmental laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our\noperations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations,\nincluding laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance\nexpenditures. Changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs\nand restrictions, including increased energy and raw materials costs. If environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant\noperational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products, they could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, results of\noperations, financial condition and competitive position.",

      "item1a":"The statements in this section describe the most significant risks to our business and should be considered carefully in conjunction with Part II, Item 7\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” of Part II, Item 8\n\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" to this Form 10-K. In addition, the statements in this section and other sections of this Form 10-K, including in\nPart II, Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" include “forward-looking statements” as that term is\ndefined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results. Forward-looking statements give\ncurrent expectations or forecasts of future events about the company or our outlook. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact they do not relate to\nhistorical or current facts and by the use of words such as “believe,” “expect,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “will be,” “should,” “plan,” “project,” “intend,” “could”\nand similar words or expressions.\nForward-looking statements are based on assumptions and on known risks and uncertainties. Although we believe we have been prudent in our assumptions, any or\nall of our forward-looking statements may prove to be inaccurate, and we can make no guarantees about our future performance. Should known or unknown risks\nor uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could materially differ from past results and/or those anticipated, estimated\nor projected.\nWe undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should,\nhowever, consult any subsequent disclosures we make in our filings with the SEC on Form 10-Q or Form 8-K.\nThe following is a cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business. In addition to the factors discussed\nelsewhere in this report, the following are some of the important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we believe could make our actual results differ\nmaterially from those described in any forward-looking statements. It is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and, as a result, you should not consider\nthe following factors to be a complete discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.\nMACROECONOMIC RISKS\nOur business and the industries we serve are highly sensitive to global and regional economic conditions.\nOur results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions globally and regionally and in the particular industries we serve. The demand for our\nproducts and services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in periods of economic weakness characterized by lower levels of government and\nbusiness investment, lower levels of business confidence, lower corporate earnings, high real interest rates, lower credit activity or tighter credit conditions,\nperceived or actual industry overcapacity, higher unemployment and lower consumer spending. A prolonged period of economic weakness may also result in\nincreased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges. Economic conditions vary across regions\nand countries, and demand for our products and services generally increases in those regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment. Slower\neconomic growth or a change in the global mix of regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe energy, transportation and mining industries are major users of our products, including the coal, iron ore, gold, copper, oil and natural gas industries.\nCustomers in these industries frequently base their decisions to purchase our products on the expected future performance of these industries, which in turn are\ndependent in part on commodity prices. Prices of commodities in these industries are frequently volatile and can change abruptly and unpredictably in response to\ngeneral economic conditions and trends, government actions, regulatory actions, commodity inventories, production and consumption levels, technological\ninnovations, commodity substitutions, market expectations and any disruptions in production or distribution. Economic conditions affecting the industries we serve\nmay in the future also lead to reduced capital expenditures by our customers. Reduced capital expenditures by our customers are likely to lead to a decrease in the\ndemand for our products and may also result in a decrease in demand for aftermarket parts as customers are likely to extend preventative maintenance schedules\nand delay major overhauls when possible.\nThe rates of infrastructure spending, housing starts and commercial construction also play a significant role in our results. Our products are an integral component\nof these activities, and as these activities decrease, demand for our products may be significantly impacted, which could negatively impact our results.\n9\nTable of Contents\nCommodity price changes, material price increases, fluctuations in demand for our products, significant disruptions to our supply chains or significant\nshortages of material may adversely impact our financial results or our ability to meet commitments to customers.\nWe are a significant user of steel and many other commodities required for the manufacture of our products. Increases in the prices of such commodities would\nincrease our costs, negatively impacting our business, results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to fully offset the effect of these increased costs\nthrough price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction programs.\nWe rely on suppliers to produce or secure material required for the manufacture of our products. A disruption in deliveries to or from suppliers or decreased\navailability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs.\nThe increase in demand in 2017 has led to challenges for certain products due to supplier constraints. Despite improvements in material flows in the second half of\n2017, parts and components constraints remain across some products, which could impact our growth potential in 2018 as our global suppliers continue to increase\nproduction to meet demand. On the other hand, in circumstances where demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience excess inventories and\nbe forced to incur additional costs and our profitability may suffer. Our business, competitive position, results of operations or financial condition could be\nnegatively impacted if supply is insufficient for our operations, if we experience excess inventories or if we are unable to adjust our production schedules or our\npurchases from suppliers to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations on a timely basis.\nChanges in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results . Most countries where our products and services are sold have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities, generally\nby adjusting interest rates. Interest rate changes affect overall economic growth, which affects demand for residential and nonresidential structures, as well as\nenergy and mined products, which in turn affects sales of our products and services that serve these activities. Interest rate changes may also affect our customers’\nability to finance machine purchases, can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production\nof parts and components necessary to manufacture and support our products. Increases in interest rates could negatively impact sales and create supply chain\ninefficiencies.\nCentral banks and other policy arms of many countries may take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available in an economy. The impact from a\nchange in liquidity and credit policies could negatively affect the customers and markets we serve or our suppliers, which could adversely impact our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in monetary and fiscal policies, along with other factors, may cause currency exchange rates to fluctuate. Actions that lead the currency exchange rate of a\ncountry where we manufacture products to increase relative to other currencies could reduce the competitiveness of products made in that country, which could\nadversely affect our competitive position, results of operations and financial condition.\nGovernment policies on taxes and spending also affect our business. Throughout the world, government spending finances a significant portion of infrastructure\ndevelopment, such as highways, airports, sewer and water systems and dams. Tax regulations determine asset depreciation lives and impact the after-tax returns on\nbusiness activity and investment, both of which influence investment decisions. Unfavorable developments, such as declines in government revenues, decisions to\nreduce public spending or increases in taxes, could negatively impact our results.\nOur global operations are exposed to political and economic risks, commercial instability and events beyond our control in the countries in which we\noperate.\nOur global operations are dependent upon products manufactured, purchased and sold in the U.S. and internationally, including in countries with political and\neconomic instability or uncertainty. This includes, for example, the uncertainty related to the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union (commonly\nknown as “Brexit”). Some countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than others. Our\nbusiness could be negatively impacted by adverse fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the\ntransportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products. Operating in different regions and countries exposes us\nto a number of risks, including: • multiple and potentially conflicting laws, regulations and policies that are subject to change; • imposition of currency restrictions, restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other restraints;\n10\nTable of Contents\n• imposition of burdensome tariffs or quotas; • changes in trade agreements; • imposition of new or additional trade and economic sanctions laws imposed by the U.S. or foreign governments; • war or terrorist acts; and\n• political and economic instability or civil unrest that may severely disrupt economic activity in affected countries.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n OPERATIONAL RISKS\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to develop, produce and market quality products that meet our customers’ needs.\nOur business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to our\ndealers, OEMs and end-user customers. This is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to maintain key dealer relationships, our ability to produce\nproducts that meet the quality, performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs.\nIn addition, our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on leading-edge innovation, with respect to both products and\noperations, and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovations. Failure to continue to deliver high quality, innovative, competitive\nproducts to the marketplace, to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements, including\nengine exhaust emission requirements or to predict market demands for, or gain market acceptance of, our products, could have a negative impact on our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment, which could adversely affect our sales and pricing.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. We compete on the basis of a variety of factors, including product performance, customer service, quality and\nprice. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies’ products. Thus, our share of industry sales could be\nreduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties, our failure to price our\nproducts competitively, our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or an unexpected buildup in competitors’ new machine or dealer-owned rental\nfleets, leading to downward pressure on machine rental rates and/or used equipment prices.\nLack of customer acceptance of price increases we announce from time to time, changes in customer requirements for price discounts, changes in our customers’\nbehavior or a weak pricing environment could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, our results and ability to compete may be impacted negatively by changes in our geographic and product mix of sales.\nIncreased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services.\nWe rely upon information technology systems and networks, some of which are managed by third parties, in connection with a variety of business activities.\nAdditionally, we collect and store data that is sensitive to Caterpillar. Operating these information technology systems and networks and processing and\nmaintaining this data, in a secure manner, are critical to our business operations and strategy. Information technology security threats -- from user error to\ncybersecurity attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems, networks and data -- are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Cybersecurity\nattacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crime and advanced persistent threats. These threats\npose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Cybersecurity attacks could also include\nattacks targeting customer data or the security, integrity and/or reliability of the hardware and software installed in our products. We have experienced\ncybersecurity attacks that have resulted in unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and networks, and we could in the future\nexperience similar attacks. However, to date, no cybersecurity attack has had a material impact on our financial condition,\n11\nTable of Contents\nresults of operations or liquidity. While we actively manage information technology security risks within our control, there can be no assurance that such actions\nwill be sufficient to mitigate all potential risks to our systems, networks and data. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity attack include\nreputational damage, litigation with third parties, disruption to systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, corruption of data,\ndiminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn\ncould adversely affect our competitiveness, results of operations and financial condition. The amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to\ncover claims or liabilities relating to a cybersecurity attack.\nWe expect to incur additional restructuring charges as we continue to contemplate cost reduction actions in an effort to optimize our cost structure and\nmay not achieve the anticipated savings and benefits of these actions.\nIn response to economic and business conditions, we have taken significant restructuring and cost reduction actions in recent years. We expect to take additional\nrestructuring actions as we continue to optimize our cost structure and improve the efficiency of our operation, which may reduce our profitability in the periods\nincurred. As a result of these actions, we will incur charges, which may include but not be limited to asset impairments, employee termination costs, charges for\npension and other postretirement contractual benefits, potential additional pension funding obligations, and pension curtailments, any of which could be significant,\nand could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from past or future cost\nreduction actions in full or in part or within the time periods we expect. We are also subject to the risks of labor unrest, negative publicity and business disruption\nin connection with our cost reduction actions. Failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our cost reduction actions could have a material adverse effect\non our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from cash flow improvement initiatives and efficiency or productivity initiatives.\nWe are actively engaged in a number of initiatives to increase our productivity, efficiency and cash flow, which we expect to have a positive long-term effect on\nour business, competitive position, results of operations and financial condition. For example, one such initiative is to implement sustained improvements in our\noperational efficiency and order-to-delivery processes so that our lead time is better aligned with customer requirements, as well as to reduce waste, further\nenhance quality and maximize value for our customers. There can be no assurance that these initiatives or others will continue to be beneficial to the extent\nanticipated, or that the estimated efficiency improvements or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all. If these initiatives are not\nimplemented successfully, it could have an adverse effect on our operations and competitive position.\nOur business is subject to the inventory management decisions and sourcing practices of our dealers and our OEM customers.\nWe sell finished products primarily through an independent dealer network and directly to OEMs and are subject to risks relating to their inventory management\ndecisions and operational and sourcing practices. Both carry inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on\ntheir assessments of future needs and market conditions, including levels of used equipment inventory. Such adjustments may impact our results positively or\nnegatively. If the inventory levels of our dealers and OEM customers are higher than they desire, they may postpone product purchases from us, which could cause\nour sales to be lower than the end-user demand for our products and negatively impact our results. Similarly, our results could be negatively impacted through the\nloss of time-sensitive sales if our dealers and OEM customers do not maintain inventory levels sufficient to meet customer demand.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures, or these benefits may take longer to realize than\nexpected.\nIn pursuing our business strategy, we routinely evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures. We often\ncompete with others for the same opportunities. To be successful, we conduct due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies, negotiate\ntransaction terms, complete complex transactions and manage post-closing matters such as the integration of acquired businesses. Further, while we seek to\nmitigate risks and liabilities of such transactions through, among other things, due diligence, there may be risks and liabilities that such due diligence efforts fail to\ndiscover, that are not accurately or completely disclosed to us or that we inadequately assess. We may incur unanticipated costs or expenses following a completed\nacquisition, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation, and other liabilities. Risks\nassociated with our past or future acquisitions also include the following:\n12\nTable of Contents\n• the business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture; • technological and product synergies, economies of scale and cost reductions may not occur as expected; • unforeseen expenses, delays or conditions may be imposed upon the acquisition, including due to required regulatory approvals or consents; • we may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities or be subject to unexpected penalties or other enforcement actions; • faulty assumptions may be made regarding the macroeconomic environment or the integration process; • unforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating operations, processes and systems; • higher than expected investments may be required to implement necessary compliance processes and related systems, including IT systems, accounting\nsystems and internal controls over financial reporting; • we may fail to retain, motivate and integrate key management and other employees of the acquired business; • higher than expected costs may arise due to unforeseen changes in tax, trade, environmental, labor, safety, payroll or pension policies in any jurisdiction in\nwhich the acquired business conducts its operations; and\n• we may experience problems in retaining customers and integrating customer bases.\nMany of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and\ndiversion of management’s time and attention. They may also delay the realization of the benefits we anticipate when we enter into a transaction.\nIn order to conserve cash for operations, we may undertake acquisitions financed in part through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities,\nor other arrangements. Such acquisition financing could result in a decrease in our earnings and adversely affect other leverage measures. If we issue equity\nsecurities or equity-linked securities, the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares.\nFailure to implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations. Furthermore, we make strategic divestitures from time to time. In the case of divestitures, we may agree to indemnify\nacquiring parties for certain liabilities arising from our former businesses. These divestitures may also result in continued financial involvement in the divested\nbusinesses, including through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Lower performance by those divested businesses could affect\nour future financial results.\nUnion disputes or other labor matters could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nSome of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and\nexpiration dates. There can be no assurance that any current or future issues with our employees will be resolved or that we will not encounter future strikes, work\nstoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees. We may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the\nUnited States and other countries when they expire. If we fail to renegotiate our existing collective bargaining agreements, we could encounter strikes or work\nstoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at our\nfacilities in the future. We may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements. A work\nstoppage or other limitations on production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition. In addition, many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces. Strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers\ncould have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nUnexpected events, including natural disasters, may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations.\nThe occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including war, terrorist acts or violence, fires, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and other\nforms of severe weather in the United States or in other countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations\nand financial performance. Natural disasters, pandemic illness, equipment failures, power outages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to\nand complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of component\nproducts from some local and international suppliers, disruption in the transport of our\n13\nTable of Contents\nproducts to dealers and end-users and delay in the delivery of our products to our distribution centers. Existing insurance coverage may not provide protection for\nall of the costs that may arise from such events.\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nDisruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit our sources of liquidity, or the liquidity of our customers, dealers and suppliers.\nContinuing to meet our cash requirements over the long-term requires substantial liquidity and access to varied sources of funds, including capital and credit\nmarkets. Global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. Market volatility, changes in counterparty credit risk,\nthe impact of government intervention in financial markets and general economic conditions may also adversely impact our ability to access capital and credit\nmarkets to fund operating needs. Global or regional economic downturns could cause financial markets to decrease the availability of liquidity, credit and credit\ncapacity for certain issuers, including certain customers, dealers and suppliers. An inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position. Furthermore, changes in global economic conditions, including material cost increases\nand decreases in economic activity in key markets we serve, and the success of plans to manage cost increases, inventory and other important elements of our\nbusiness may significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations.\nIn addition, demand for our products generally depends on customers’ ability to pay for our products, which, in turn, depends on their access to funds. Changes in\nglobal economic conditions may result in customers experiencing increased difficulty in generating funds from operations. Capital and credit market volatility and\nuncertainty may cause financial institutions to revise their lending standards, resulting in customers’ decreased access to capital. If capital and credit market\nvolatility occurs, customers’ liquidity may decline which, in turn, would reduce their ability to purchase our products.\nFailure to maintain our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position\nand access to capital markets.\nEach of Caterpillar’s and Cat Financial’s costs of borrowing and their respective ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but\nalso by the short- and long-term credit ratings assigned to their respective debt by the major credit rating agencies. These ratings are based, in significant part, on\neach of Caterpillar’s and Cat Financial’s performance as measured by financial metrics such as net worth, interest coverage and leverage ratios, as well as\ntransparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. There can be no assurance that Caterpillar or Cat Financial will be able to maintain their\ncredit ratings. On December 13, 2016, Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) downgraded the long- and short-term ratings of Caterpillar and Cat Financial to A3\nfrom A2 and to Prime-2 from Prime-1. A further downgrade of Caterpillar or Cat Financial’s credit ratings by Moody’s or one of the other major credit rating\nagencies would result in increased borrowing costs and could adversely affect Caterpillar’s and Cat Financial’s liquidity, competitive position and access to the\ncapital markets, including restricting, in whole or in part, access to the commercial paper market. There can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will\ncontinue to be a reliable source of short-term financing for Cat Financial or an available source of short-term financing for Caterpillar. An inability to access the\ncapital markets could have an adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur Financial Products segment is subject to risks associated with the financial services industry.\nCat Financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support to a significant share of our global sales. The inability of Cat Financial to access funds\nto support its financing activities to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nContinuing to meet Cat Financial's cash requirements over the long-term could require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds, including capital and\ncredit markets. Cat Financial has continued to maintain access to key global medium term note and commercial paper markets, but there can be no assurance that\nsuch markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing. If global economic conditions were to deteriorate, Cat Financial could face materially higher\nfinancing costs, become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow its business and/or meet its debt service obligations as they mature, and be required\nto draw upon contractually committed lending agreements and/or seek other funding sources. However, there can be no assurance that such agreements and other\nfunding sources would be available or sufficient under extreme market conditions. Any of these events could negatively impact Cat Financial’s business, as well as\nour and Cat Financial's results of operations and financial condition.\n14\nTable of Contents\nMarket disruption and volatility may also lead to a number of other risks in connection with these events, including but not limited to: • Market developments that may affect customer confidence levels and cause declines in the demand for financing and adverse changes in payment\npatterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could impact Cat Financial’s write-offs and provision for credit losses. • The process Cat Financial uses to estimate losses inherent in its credit exposure requires a high degree of management’s judgment regarding numerous\nsubjective qualitative factors, including forecasts of economic conditions and how economic predictors might impair the ability of its borrowers to repay\ntheir loans. Financial market disruption and volatility may impact the accuracy of these judgments. • Cat Financial’s ability to engage in routine funding transactions or borrow from other financial institutions on acceptable terms or at all could be adversely\naffected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations. • As Cat Financial’s lending agreements are primarily with financial institutions, their ability to perform in accordance with any of its underlying\nagreements could be adversely affected by market volatility and/or disruptions in financial markets.\nChanges in interest rates or market liquidity conditions could adversely affect Cat Financial's and our earnings and/or cash flow.\nChanges in interest rates and market liquidity conditions could have an adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows. Because a significant\nnumber of the loans made by Cat Financial are made at fixed interest rates, its business is subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Changes in market interest rates\nmay influence its financing costs, returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce its and our earnings and cash flows.\nAlthough Cat Financial manages interest rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques, including a match funding program, the selective use of\nderivatives and a broadly diversified funding program, there can be no assurance that fluctuations in interest rates and market liquidity conditions will not have an\nadverse effect on its and our earnings and cash flows. If any of the variety of instruments and strategies Cat Financial uses to hedge its exposure to these types of\nrisk is ineffective, we may incur losses. With respect to Insurance Services' investment activities, changes in the equity and bond markets could cause an\nimpairment of the value of its investment portfolio, requiring a negative adjustment to earnings.\nAn increase in delinquencies, repossessions or net losses of Cat Financial customers could adversely affect its results.\nInherent in the operation of Cat Financial is the credit risk associated with its customers. The creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies,\nrepossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors, including relevant industry and economic conditions, the availability\nof capital, the experience and expertise of the customer's management team, commodity prices, political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral.\nAny increase in delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations could have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and\ncash flows. In addition, although Cat Financial evaluates and adjusts its allowance for credit losses related to past due and non-performing receivables on a regular\nbasis, adverse economic conditions or other factors that might cause deterioration of the financial health of its customers could change the timing and level of\npayments received and necessitate an increase in Cat Financial's estimated losses, which could also have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our\nearnings and cash flows.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations.\nWe conduct operations in many countries involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent\nthat our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates have had, and will continue to\nhave, an impact on our results as expressed in U.S. dollars. There can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results\nof operations, financial condition and cash flows. While the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in\ncurrency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nIn addition, our outlooks do not assume fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates from the date of our outlooks\ncould cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in our outlooks and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\n15\nTable of Contents\nWe also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign\ncurrencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing\ncontrols. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation.\nRestrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility.\nWe maintain a number of credit facilities to support general corporate purposes (facilities) and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations\n(debt securities). The agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain\nsubsidiaries, including Cat Financial. These covenants include maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth (defined as the consolidated shareholder’s equity\nincluding preferred stock but excluding the pension and other post-retirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)), limitations\non the incurrence of liens and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger. Cat Financial has also agreed under certain of these agreements not to exceed a\ncertain leverage ratio (consolidated debt to consolidated net worth, calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day\nof each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each December 31), to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio (profit excluding income taxes, interest\nexpense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to interest expense, calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then\nmost recently ended) and not to terminate, amend or modify its support agreement with us.\nA breach of one or more of the covenants could result in adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition. These consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities, triggering of an obligation to redeem certain\ndebt securities, termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders, refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to\nenter into new facilities or the lowering or modification of our credit ratings or those of one or more of our subsidiaries.\nSustained increases in funding obligations under our pension plans may impair our liquidity or financial condition.\nWe maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for our employees, which impose on us certain funding obligations. In determining our future payment\nobligations under the plans, we assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and a certain level of future benefit payments. Significant adverse changes in credit\nor capital markets could result in actual rates of return being materially lower than projected and increased contribution requirements. We are expecting to make\ncontributions to our pension plans in the future, and may be required to make contributions that could be material. We may fund contributions through the use of\ncash on hand, the proceeds of borrowings, shares of our common stock or a combination of the foregoing, as permitted by applicable law. Our assumptions for\nfuture benefit payments may also be materially higher than projected. These factors could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans, and as a\nresult, adversely affect our business and overall financial condition.\nLEGAL & REGULATORY RISKS\nOur global operations are subject to extensive trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations.\nDue to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations\nissued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Antiboycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls\nand the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries. Any alleged or actual violations may subject us to\ngovernment scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the\nUnited States. Furthermore, embargoes and sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries or\nbased on product classification may expose us to potential criminal and civil sanctions. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory\nrequirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nIn addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making\nimproper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or\nobtaining an unfair advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Our operations outside the United\nStates, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations. Violations of anti-corruption laws or regulations by our employees, by\nintermediaries acting on our behalf, or by our joint venture partners may result in severe criminal or civil\n16\nTable of Contents\nsanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.\nInternational trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position.\nGovernment policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas, capital controls or tariffs, whether adopted by individual governments or\naddressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being\nable to sell products in certain countries. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs or new barriers to\nentry, in countries where we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. For\nexample, a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results\nof operations.\nWe may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the\neffective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our overall profitability, changes in tax\nlaws or treaties or in their application or interpretation, changes in tax rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, the results of audits and examinations\nof previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures. We are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the\nU.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations. If our\neffective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating\nresults, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. For information regarding additional legal matters related to our taxes, please see Note 5 —\n\"Income taxes\" and Note 22 — \"Environmental and legal matters\" of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" to this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K . Costs associated with lawsuits or investigations or adverse rulings in enforcement or other legal proceedings may have an adverse effect on our results of\noperations.\nWe are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in virtually every part of the world. We face risk of exposure to various types of claims,\nlawsuits and government investigations. We are involved in various claims and lawsuits related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including\nclaimed asbestos and welding fumes exposure), contracts, employment issues, environmental matters, intellectual property rights, tax, securities and other legal\nproceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business. The industries in which we operate are also periodically reviewed or investigated by\nregulators, which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims. It is not possible to predict with certainty the\noutcome of claims, investigations and lawsuits, and we could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that\ncould have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition in any particular period.\nThe global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other\ncontingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time. In addition, subsequent developments in legal proceedings\nmay affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have\nan adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nNew regulations or changes in financial services regulation could adversely impact Caterpillar and Cat Financial.\nCat Financial’s operations are highly regulated by governmental authorities in the locations where it operates, which can impose significant additional costs and/or\nrestrictions on its business. In the U.S., for example, certain Cat Financial activities are subject to the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act (Dodd-Frank), which includes extensive provisions regulating the financial services industry. As such, Cat Financial has become and could continue\nto become subject to additional regulatory costs that could be significant and have an adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our results of operations and financial\ncondition. Additional regulations in the U.S. or internationally impacting the financial services industry could also add significant cost or operational constraints\nthat might have an adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our results of operations and financial condition.\n17\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs.\nOur facilities, operations and products are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations globally, including laws and regulations governing\nemissions to noise, air, releases to soil and discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of non-hazardous and\nhazardous waste materials. Some environmental laws impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous\nsubstances, even for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred, or for the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators, predecessors or other third\nparties. Failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to penalties or clean-up costs, civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our\nactivities, as well as damage to property or natural resources. The potential liabilities, sanctions, damages and remediation efforts related to any non-compliance\nwith such laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there\ncan be no assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under\npresent laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations may change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. Changes in environmental laws or\nregulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to environmental laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our\noperations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations,\nincluding laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance\nexpenditures. Changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs\nand restrictions, including increased energy and raw materials costs. If environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant\noperational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products, they could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, results of\noperations, financial condition and competitive position.",

      "item1a":"The statements in this section describe the most significant risks to our business and should be considered carefully in conjunction with Part II, Item 7\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” of Part II, Item 8\n\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" to this Form 10-K. In addition, the statements in this section and other sections of this Form 10-K, including in\nPart II, Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" include “forward-looking statements” as that term is\ndefined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results. Forward-looking statements give\ncurrent expectations or forecasts of future events about the company or our outlook. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact they do not relate to\nhistorical or current facts and by the use of words such as “believe,” “expect,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “will be,” “should,” “plan,” “forecast,” “target,” “guide,”\n“project,” “intend,” “could” and similar words or expressions.\n8\nTable of Contents\nForward-looking statements are based on assumptions and on known risks and uncertainties. Although we believe we have been prudent in our assumptions, any or\nall of our forward-looking statements may prove to be inaccurate, and we can make no guarantees about our future performance. Should known or unknown risks\nor uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could materially differ from past results and/or those anticipated, estimated\nor projected.\nWe undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should,\nhowever, consult any subsequent disclosures we make in our filings with the SEC on Form 10-Q or Form 8-K.\nThe following is a cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business. In addition to the factors discussed\nelsewhere in this report, the following are some of the important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we believe could make our actual results differ\nmaterially from those described in any forward-looking statements. It is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and, as a result, you should not consider\nthe following factors to be a complete discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.\nMACROECONOMIC RISKS\nOur business and the industries we serve are highly sensitive to global and regional economic conditions.\nOur results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions globally and regionally and in the particular industries we serve. The demand for our\nproducts and services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in periods of economic weakness characterized by lower levels of government and\nbusiness investment, lower levels of business confidence, lower corporate earnings, high real interest rates, lower credit activity or tighter credit conditions,\nperceived or actual industry overcapacity, higher unemployment and lower consumer spending. A prolonged period of economic weakness may also result in\nincreased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges. Economic conditions vary across regions\nand countries, and demand for our products and services generally increases in those regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment. Slower\neconomic growth or a change in the global mix of regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe energy, transportation and mining industries are major users of our products, including the coal, iron ore, gold, copper, oil and natural gas industries.\nCustomers in these industries frequently base their decisions to purchase our products and services on the expected future performance of these industries, which in\nturn are dependent in part on commodity prices. Prices of commodities in these industries are frequently volatile and can change abruptly and unpredictably in\nresponse to general economic conditions and trends, government actions, regulatory actions, commodity inventories, production and consumption levels,\ntechnological innovations, commodity substitutions, market expectations and any disruptions in production or distribution or changes in consumption. Economic\nconditions affecting the industries we serve may in the future also lead to reduced capital expenditures by our customers. Reduced capital expenditures by our\ncustomers are likely to lead to a decrease in the demand for our products and services and may also result in a decrease in demand for aftermarket parts as\ncustomers are likely to extend preventative maintenance schedules and delay major overhauls when possible.\nThe rates of infrastructure spending, commercial construction and housing starts also play a significant role in our results. Our products are an integral component\nof these activities, and as these activities decrease, demand for our products may be significantly impacted, which could negatively impact our results.\nCommodity price changes, material price increases, fluctuations in demand for our products, significant disruptions to our supply chains or significant\nshortages of material may adversely impact our financial results or our ability to meet commitments to customers.\nWe are a significant user of steel and many other commodities required for the manufacture of our products. Increases in the prices of such commodities would\nincrease our costs, negatively impacting our business, results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to fully offset the effect of these increased costs\nthrough price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction programs.\nWe rely on suppliers to produce or secure material required for the manufacture of our products. Production challenges at suppliers, a disruption in deliveries to or\nfrom suppliers or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or\nincrease our operating costs. The increase in demand in\n9\nTable of Contents\n2018 has led to challenges for certain products due to supplier constraints. Despite improvements in material flows, parts and components constraints remain across\nsome products, which could impact our sales in 2019 as global suppliers continue to increase production to meet demand. On the other hand, in circumstances\nwhere demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience excess inventories and be forced to incur additional costs and our profitability may\nsuffer. Our business, competitive position, results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted if supply is insufficient for our operations, if\nwe experience excess inventories or if we are unable to adjust our production schedules or our purchases from suppliers to reflect changes in customer demand and\nmarket fluctuations on a timely basis.\nChanges in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results . Most countries where our products and services are sold have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities, generally\nby adjusting interest rates. Interest rate changes affect overall economic growth, which affects demand for residential and nonresidential structures, as well as\nenergy and mined products, which in turn affects sales of our products and services that serve these activities. Interest rate changes may also affect our customers’\nability to finance machine purchases, can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production\nof parts and components necessary to manufacture and support our products. Increases in interest rates could negatively impact sales and create supply chain\ninefficiencies.\nCentral banks and other policy arms of many countries may take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available in an economy. The impact from a\nchange in liquidity and credit policies could negatively affect the customers and markets we serve or our suppliers, which could adversely impact our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in monetary and fiscal policies, along with other factors, may cause currency exchange rates to fluctuate. Actions that lead the currency exchange rate of a\ncountry where we manufacture products to increase relative to other currencies could reduce the competitiveness of products made in that country, which could\nadversely affect our competitive position, results of operations and financial condition.\nGovernment policies on taxes and spending also affect our business. Throughout the world, government spending finances a significant portion of infrastructure\ndevelopment, such as highways, airports, sewer and water systems and dams. Tax regulations determine asset depreciation lives and impact the after-tax returns on\nbusiness activity and investment, both of which influence investment decisions. Unfavorable developments, such as decisions to reduce public spending or\nincrease taxes, could negatively impact our results.\nOur global operations are exposed to political and economic risks, commercial instability and global events beyond our control in the countries in which\nwe operate.\nOur global operations are dependent upon products manufactured, purchased and sold in the U.S. and internationally, including in countries with political and\neconomic instability or uncertainty. This includes, for example, the uncertainty related to the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union (commonly\nknown as “Brexit”). Some countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than others. Our\nbusiness could be negatively impacted by adverse fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the\ntransportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products. Operating in different regions and countries exposes us\nto a number of risks, including: • multiple and potentially conflicting laws, regulations and policies that are subject to change; • imposition of currency restrictions, restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other restraints; • imposition of new or additional tariffs or quotas; • withdrawal from or modification of trade agreements or the negotiation of new trade agreements; • imposition of new or additional trade and economic sanctions laws imposed by the U.S. or foreign governments; • war or terrorist acts; and\n• political and economic instability or civil unrest that may severely disrupt economic activity in affected countries.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n10\nTable of Contents\n OPERATIONAL RISKS\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to develop, produce and market quality products that meet our customers’ needs.\nOur business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to our\ndealers, OEMs and end-user customers. This is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to maintain key dealer relationships, our ability to produce\nproducts that meet the quality, performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs.\nIn addition, our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on leading-edge innovation, with respect to both products and\noperations, and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovations. Failure to continue to deliver high quality, innovative, competitive\nproducts to the marketplace, to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements, including\nengine exhaust emission requirements, or to predict market demands for, or gain market acceptance of, our products, could have a negative impact on our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment, which could adversely affect our sales and pricing.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. We compete on the basis of a variety of factors, including product performance, customer service, quality and\nprice. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies’ products. Thus, our share of industry sales could be\nreduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties, our failure to price our\nproducts competitively, our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or an unexpected buildup in competitors’ new machine or dealer-owned rental\nfleets, which could lead to downward pressure on machine rental rates and/or used equipment prices.\nLack of customer acceptance of price increases we announce from time to time, changes in customer requirements for price discounts, changes in our customers’\nbehavior or a weak pricing environment could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, our results and ability to compete may be impacted negatively by changes in our geographic and product mix of sales.\nIncreased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services.\nWe rely upon information technology systems and networks, some of which are managed by third parties, in connection with a variety of business activities.\nAdditionally, we collect and store data that is sensitive to Caterpillar. Operating these information technology systems and networks and processing and\nmaintaining this data, in a secure manner, are critical to our business operations and strategy. Data we collect, store and process is subject to a variety of U.S. and\ninternational laws and regulations, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation that became effective in May 2018, which carry, in many\ncases, significant potential penalties for noncompliance. Information technology security threats -- from user error to cybersecurity attacks designed to gain\nunauthorized access to our systems, networks and data -- are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to\ncoordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crime and advanced persistent threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems\nand networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Cybersecurity attacks could also include attacks targeting customer data or the security,\nintegrity and/or reliability of the hardware and software installed in our products. While, to date, no cybersecurity attack has had a material impact on our financial\ncondition, results of operations or liquidity, we have experienced cybersecurity attacks that have resulted in unauthorized parties gaining access to our information\ntechnology systems and networks, and we could in the future experience similar or more serious attacks. While we actively manage information technology\nsecurity risks within our control, such actions may not be sufficient to mitigate all potential risks to our systems, networks and data. Further, the amount of\ninsurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover claims or liabilities relating to a cybersecurity attack. The potential consequences of a material\ncybersecurity attack include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, government enforcement actions, penalties, disruption to systems, unauthorized\nrelease of confidential or otherwise protected information, corruption of data, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering,\nand increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\n11\nTable of Contents\nOur business is subject to the inventory management decisions and sourcing practices of our dealers and our OEM customers.\nWe sell finished products primarily through an independent dealer network and directly to OEMs and are subject to risks relating to their inventory management\ndecisions and operational and sourcing practices. Both carry inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on\ntheir assessments of future needs and market conditions, including levels of used equipment inventory and machine rental usage rates. Such adjustments may\nimpact our results positively or negatively. If the inventory levels of our dealers and OEM customers are higher than they desire, they may postpone product\npurchases from us, which could cause our sales to be lower than the end-user demand for our products and negatively impact our results. Similarly, our results\ncould be negatively impacted through the loss of time-sensitive sales if our dealers and OEM customers do not maintain inventory levels sufficient to meet\ncustomer demand.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures, or these benefits may take longer to realize than\nexpected.\nIn pursuing our business strategy, we routinely evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures. We often\ncompete with others for the same opportunities. To be successful, we conduct due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies, negotiate\ntransaction terms, complete complex transactions and manage post-closing matters such as the integration of acquired businesses. Further, while we seek to\nmitigate risks and liabilities of such transactions through, among other things, due diligence, there may be risks and liabilities that such due diligence efforts fail to\ndiscover, that are not accurately or completely disclosed to us or that we inadequately assess. We may incur unanticipated costs or expenses following a completed\nacquisition, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation, and other liabilities. Risks\nassociated with our past or future acquisitions also include the following: • the business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture; • technological and product synergies, economies of scale and cost reductions may not occur as expected; • unforeseen expenses, delays or conditions may be imposed upon the acquisition, including due to required regulatory approvals or consents; • we may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities or be subject to unexpected penalties or other enforcement actions; • faulty assumptions may be made regarding the macroeconomic environment or the integration process; • unforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating operations, processes and systems; • higher than expected investments may be required to implement necessary compliance processes and related systems, including IT systems, accounting\nsystems and internal controls over financial reporting; • we may fail to retain, motivate and integrate key management and other employees of the acquired business; • higher than expected costs may arise due to unforeseen changes in tax, trade, environmental, labor, safety, payroll or pension policies in any jurisdiction in\nwhich the acquired business conducts its operations; and\n• we may experience problems in retaining customers and integrating customer bases.\nMany of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and\ndiversion of management’s time and attention. They may also delay the realization of the benefits we anticipate when we enter into a transaction.\nIn order to conserve cash for operations, we may undertake acquisitions financed in part through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities,\nor other arrangements. Such acquisition financing could result in a decrease in our earnings and adversely affect other leverage measures. If we issue equity\nsecurities or equity-linked securities, the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares.\nFailure to implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations. Furthermore, we make strategic divestitures from time to time. In the case of divestitures, we may agree to indemnify\nacquiring parties for certain liabilities arising from our former businesses. These divestitures may also result in continued financial involvement in the divested\nbusinesses, including through\n12\nTable of Contents\nguarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Lower performance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results.\nUnion disputes or other labor matters could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nSome of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and\nexpiration dates. There can be no assurance that any current or future issues with our employees will be resolved or that we will not encounter future strikes, work\nstoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees. We may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the\nUnited States and other countries when they expire. If we fail to renegotiate our existing collective bargaining agreements, we could encounter strikes or work\nstoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at our\nfacilities in the future. We may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements. A work\nstoppage or other limitations on production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition. In addition, many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces. Strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers\ncould have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nUnexpected events, including natural disasters, may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations.\nThe occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including war, terrorist acts or violence, civil unrest, fires, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods\nand other forms of severe weather in the United States or in other countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our\noperations and financial performance. Natural disasters, pandemic illness, equipment failures, power outages or other unexpected events could result in physical\ndamage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of\ncomponent products from some local and international suppliers, disruption in the transport of our products to dealers and end-users and delay in the delivery of\nour products to our distribution centers. Existing insurance coverage may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events.\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nDisruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit our sources of liquidity, or the liquidity of our customers, dealers and suppliers.\nContinuing to meet our cash requirements over the long-term requires substantial liquidity and access to varied sources of funds, including capital and credit\nmarkets. Global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. Market volatility, changes in counterparty credit risk,\nthe impact of government intervention in financial markets and general economic conditions may also adversely impact our ability to access capital and credit\nmarkets to fund operating needs. Global or regional economic downturns could cause financial markets to decrease the availability of liquidity, credit and credit\ncapacity for certain issuers, including certain customers, dealers and suppliers. An inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position. Furthermore, changes in global economic conditions, including material cost increases\nand decreases in economic activity in key markets we serve, and the success of plans to manage cost increases, inventory and other important elements of our\nbusiness may significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations.\nIn addition, demand for our products generally depends on customers’ ability to pay for our products, which, in turn, depends on their access to funds. Changes in\nglobal economic conditions may result in customers experiencing increased difficulty in generating funds from operations. Capital and credit market volatility and\nuncertainty may cause financial institutions to revise their lending standards, resulting in customers’ decreased access to capital. If capital and credit market\nvolatility occurs, customers’ liquidity may decline which, in turn, would reduce their ability to purchase our products.\nFailure to maintain our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position\nand access to capital markets.\nEach of Caterpillar’s and Cat Financial’s costs of borrowing and their respective ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but\nalso by the short- and long-term credit ratings assigned to their respective debt by the major credit rating agencies. These ratings are based, in significant part, on\neach of Caterpillar’s and Cat Financial’s performance as measured by financial metrics such as net worth, interest coverage and leverage ratios, as well as\ntransparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. There can be no assurance that Caterpillar or Cat Financial will be able to maintain their\ncredit ratings. We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies. Moody’s\n13\nTable of Contents\nlong- and short-term ratings of Caterpillar and Cat Financial are A3 and Prime-2 (“low-A”), while other major credit rating agencies maintain a “mid-A” debt\nrating. A downgrade of our credit rating by any of the major credit rating agencies would result in increased borrowing costs and could adversely affect\nCaterpillar’s and Cat Financial’s liquidity, competitive position and access to the capital markets, including restricting, in whole or in part, access to the\ncommercial paper market. There can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will continue to be a reliable source of short-term financing for Cat\nFinancial or an available source of short-term financing for Caterpillar. An inability to access the capital markets could have an adverse effect on our cash flow,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nOur Financial Products segment is subject to risks associated with the financial services industry.\nCat Financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support to a significant share of our global sales. The inability of Cat Financial to access funds\nto support its financing activities to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nContinuing to meet Cat Financial's cash requirements over the long-term could require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds, including capital and\ncredit markets. Cat Financial has continued to maintain access to key global medium term note and commercial paper markets, but there can be no assurance that\nsuch markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing. If global economic conditions were to deteriorate, Cat Financial could face materially higher\nfinancing costs, become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow its business and/or meet its debt service obligations as they mature, and be required\nto draw upon contractually committed lending agreements and/or seek other funding sources. However, there can be no assurance that such agreements and other\nfunding sources would be available or sufficient under extreme market conditions. Any of these events could negatively impact Cat Financial’s business, as well as\nour and Cat Financial's results of operations and financial condition.\nMarket disruption and volatility may also lead to a number of other risks in connection with these events, including but not limited to: • Market developments that may affect customer confidence levels and cause declines in the demand for financing and adverse changes in payment\npatterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could impact Cat Financial’s write-offs and provision for credit losses. • The process Cat Financial uses to estimate losses inherent in its credit exposure requires a high degree of management’s judgment regarding numerous\nsubjective qualitative factors, including forecasts of economic conditions and how economic predictors might impair the ability of its borrowers to repay\ntheir loans. Financial market disruption and volatility may impact the accuracy of these judgments. • Cat Financial’s ability to engage in routine funding transactions or borrow from other financial institutions on acceptable terms or at all could be adversely\naffected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations. • As Cat Financial’s lending agreements are primarily with financial institutions, their ability to perform in accordance with any of its underlying\nagreements could be adversely affected by market volatility and/or disruptions in financial markets.\nChanges in interest rates or market liquidity conditions could adversely affect Cat Financial's and our earnings and/or cash flow.\nChanges in interest rates and market liquidity conditions could have an adverse impact on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows. Because a significant\nnumber of the loans made by Cat Financial are made at fixed interest rates, its business results are subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Certain loans made by\nCat Financial and financing extended to Cat Financial are made at variable rates that use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. LIBOR is the\nsubject of recent proposals for reform. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or\ncompelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. These reforms may cause LIBOR to cease to exist, new methods of calculating LIBOR to be established or\nthe establishment of an alternative reference rate(s). These consequences cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for or\nvalue of LIBOR-linked securities, loans, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to Cat Financial. Changes in market interest rates\nmay influence Cat Financial’s financing costs, returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce its and our earnings and\ncash flows. Cat Financial manages interest rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques that include a match funding program, the selective use of\nderivatives and a broadly diversified funding\n14\nTable of Contents\nprogram. There can be no assurance, however, that fluctuations in interest rates and market liquidity conditions will not have an adverse impact on its and our\nearnings and cash flows. If any of the variety of instruments and strategies Cat Financial uses to hedge its exposure to these types of risk is ineffective, we may\nhave an adverse impact on our earnings and cash flows. With respect to Insurance Services' investment activities, changes in the equity and bond markets could\nresult in a decline in value of its investment portfolio, resulting in an unfavorable impact to earnings.\nAn increase in delinquencies, repossessions or net losses of Cat Financial customers could adversely affect its results.\nInherent in the operation of Cat Financial is the credit risk associated with its customers. The creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies,\nrepossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors, including relevant industry and economic conditions, the availability\nof capital, the experience and expertise of the customer's management team, commodity prices, political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral.\nAny increase in delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations could have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and\ncash flows. In addition, although Cat Financial evaluates and adjusts its allowance for credit losses related to past due and non-performing receivables on a regular\nbasis, adverse economic conditions or other factors that might cause deterioration of the financial health of its customers could change the timing and level of\npayments received and necessitate an increase in Cat Financial's estimated losses, which could also have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our\nearnings and cash flows.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations.\nWe conduct operations in many countries involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent\nthat our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates have had, and will continue to\nhave, an impact on our results as expressed in U.S. dollars. There can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results\nof operations, financial condition and cash flows. While the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in\ncurrency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nIn addition, our outlooks do not assume fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates from the date of our outlooks\ncould cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in our outlooks and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nWe also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign\ncurrencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing\ncontrols. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation.\nRestrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility.\nWe maintain a number of credit facilities to support general corporate purposes (facilities) and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations\n(debt securities). The agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain\nsubsidiaries, including Cat Financial. These covenants include maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth (defined as the consolidated shareholder’s equity\nincluding preferred stock but excluding the pension and other post-retirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)), limitations\non the incurrence of liens and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger. Cat Financial has also agreed under certain of these agreements not to exceed a\ncertain leverage ratio (consolidated debt to consolidated net worth, calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day\nof each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each December 31), to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio (profit excluding income taxes, interest\nexpense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to interest expense, calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then\nmost recently ended) and not to terminate, amend or modify its support agreement with us.\nA breach of one or more of the covenants could result in adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition. These consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities, triggering of an obligation to redeem certain\ndebt securities, termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders, refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to\nenter into new facilities or the lowering or modification of our credit ratings or those of one or more of our subsidiaries.\n15\nTable of Contents\nSustained increases in funding obligations under our pension plans may impair our liquidity or financial condition.\nWe maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for our employees, which impose on us certain funding obligations. In determining our future payment\nobligations under the plans, we assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and a certain level of future benefit payments. Significant adverse changes in credit\nor capital markets could result in actual rates of return being materially lower than projected and result in increased contribution requirements. Our assumptions\nfor future benefit payments may also change over time and could be materially higher than originally projected. We are expecting to make contributions to our\npension plans in the future, and may be required to make contributions that could be material. We may fund contributions through the use of cash on hand, the\nproceeds of borrowings, shares of our common stock or a combination of the foregoing, as permitted by applicable law. Our assumptions for future benefit\npayments may also be materially higher than projected. These factors could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans, and as a result,\nadversely affect our business and overall financial condition.\nLEGAL & REGULATORY RISKS\nOur global operations are subject to extensive trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations.\nDue to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations\nissued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Antiboycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls\nand the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries. Any alleged or actual violations may subject us to\ngovernment scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the\nUnited States. Furthermore, embargoes and sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries or\nbased on product classification may expose us to potential criminal and civil sanctions. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory\nrequirements to which our operations might be subject or in certain locations the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nIn addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making\nimproper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or\nobtaining an unfair advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Our operations outside the United\nStates, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations. Violations of anti-corruption laws or regulations by our employees, by\nintermediaries acting on our behalf, or by our joint venture partners may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an\nadverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.\nInternational trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position.\nGovernment policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas, capital controls or tariffs, whether adopted by individual governments or\naddressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being\nable to sell products in certain countries. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs or new barriers to\nentry, in countries where we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. For\nexample, a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results\nof operations.\nWe may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the\neffective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings between U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions or among jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates,\nchanges in our overall profitability, changes in tax laws or treaties or in their application or interpretation, changes in tax rates, changes in generally accepted\naccounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested in certain non-U.S.\njurisdictions, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures. We are also subject to the\ncontinuous examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse\noutcome resulting from these examinations. If our effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess\nof amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. For information regarding additional legal\nmatters related to our taxes, please see Note 6 — \"Income taxes\" and Note 22 —\n16\nTable of Contents\n\"Environmental and legal matters\" of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" to this Annual Report on Form 10-K . Costs associated with lawsuits or investigations or adverse rulings in enforcement or other legal proceedings may have an adverse effect on our results of\noperations.\nWe are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in virtually every part of the world. We face risk of exposure to various types of claims,\nlawsuits and government investigations. We are involved in various claims and lawsuits related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including\nclaimed asbestos and welding fumes exposure), contracts, employment issues, environmental matters, intellectual property rights, tax, securities and other legal\nproceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business. The industries in which we operate are also periodically reviewed or investigated by\nregulators, which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims. It is not possible to predict with certainty the\noutcome of claims, investigations and lawsuits, and we could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that\ncould have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition in any particular period.\nThe global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other\ncontingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time. In addition, subsequent developments in legal proceedings\nmay affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have\nan adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nNew regulations or changes in financial services regulation could adversely impact Caterpillar and Cat Financial.\nCat Financial’s operations are highly regulated by governmental authorities in the locations where it operates, which can impose significant additional costs and/or\nrestrictions on its business. In the U.S., for example, certain Cat Financial activities are subject to the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act (Dodd-Frank), which includes extensive provisions regulating the financial services industry. Certain aspects of Dodd-Frank remain to be\nimplemented under the rulemaking and regulatory authority of the SEC, the CFTC and federal banking regulators. As such, Cat Financial has become and could\ncontinue to become subject to additional regulatory costs that could be significant and have an adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our results of operations and\nfinancial condition. Changes in regulations or additional regulations in the U.S. or internationally impacting the financial services industry could also add\nsignificant cost or operational constraints that might have an adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs.\nOur facilities, operations and products are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations globally, including laws and regulations governing\nemissions to noise, air, releases to soil and discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of non-hazardous and\nhazardous waste materials. Some environmental laws impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous\nsubstances, even for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred, or for the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators, predecessors or other third\nparties. Failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to penalties or clean-up costs, civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our\nactivities, as well as damage to property or natural resources. The potential liabilities, sanctions, damages and remediation efforts related to any non-compliance\nwith such laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there\ncan be no assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under\npresent laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations may change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. Changes in environmental laws or\nregulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to environmental laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our\noperations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations,\nincluding laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance\nexpenditures. Changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs\nand restrictions, including increased energy and raw materials costs. If environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant\noperational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products, they could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, results of\noperations, financial condition and competitive position.",

      "item1a":"The statements in this section describe the most significant risks to our business and should be considered carefully in conjunction with Part II, Item 7\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” of Part II, Item 8\n“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” to this Form 10-K. In addition, the statements in this section and other sections of this Form 10-K, including in\nPart II, Item 7 “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” include “forward-looking statements” as that term is\ndefined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results. Forward-looking statements give\ncurrent expectations or forecasts of future events about the company or our outlook. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact they do not relate to\nhistorical or current facts and by the use of words such as “believe,” “expect,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “will be,” “should,” “plan,” “forecast,” “target,” “guide,”\n“project,” “intend,” “could” and similar words or expressions.\n8\nTable of Contents\nForward-looking statements are based on assumptions and on known risks and uncertainties. Although we believe we have been prudent in our assumptions, any or\nall of our forward-looking statements may prove to be inaccurate, and we can make no guarantees about our future performance. Should known or unknown risks\nor uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could materially differ from past results and/or those anticipated, estimated\nor projected.\nWe undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should,\nhowever, consult any subsequent disclosures we make in our filings with the SEC on Form 10-Q or Form 8-K.\nThe following is a cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business. In addition to the factors discussed\nelsewhere in this report, the following are some of the important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we believe could make our actual results differ\nmaterially from those described in any forward-looking statements. It is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and, as a result, you should not consider\nthe following factors to be a complete discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.\nMACROECONOMIC RISKS\nOur business and the industries we serve are highly sensitive to global and regional economic conditions.\nOur results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions globally and regionally and in the particular industries we serve. The demand for our\nproducts and services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in periods of economic weakness characterized by lower levels of government and\nbusiness investment, lower levels of business confidence, lower corporate earnings, high real interest rates, lower credit activity or tighter credit conditions,\nperceived or actual industry overcapacity, higher unemployment and lower consumer spending. A prolonged period of economic weakness may also result in\nincreased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges. Economic conditions vary across regions\nand countries, and demand for our products and services generally increases in those regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment. Slower\neconomic growth or a change in the global mix of regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe energy, transportation and mining industries are major users of our products, including the coal, iron ore, gold, copper, oil and natural gas industries.\nCustomers in these industries frequently base their decisions to purchase our products and services on the expected future performance of these industries, which in\nturn are dependent in part on commodity prices. Prices of commodities in these industries are frequently volatile and can change abruptly and unpredictably in\nresponse to general economic conditions and trends, government actions, regulatory actions, commodity inventories, production and consumption levels,\ntechnological innovations, commodity substitutions, market expectations and any disruptions in production or distribution or changes in consumption. Economic\nconditions affecting the industries we serve may in the future also lead to reduced capital expenditures by our customers. Reduced capital expenditures by our\ncustomers are likely to lead to a decrease in the demand for our products and services and may also result in a decrease in demand for aftermarket parts as\ncustomers are likely to extend preventative maintenance schedules and delay major overhauls when possible.\nThe rates of infrastructure spending, commercial construction and housing starts also play a significant role in our results. Our products are an integral component\nof these activities, and as these activities decrease, demand for our products may be significantly impacted, which could negatively impact our results.\nCommodity price changes, material price increases, fluctuations in demand for our products, significant disruptions to our supply chains or significant\nshortages of material may adversely impact our financial results or our ability to meet commitments to customers.\nWe are a significant user of steel and many other commodities required for the manufacture of our products. Increases in the prices of such commodities would\nincrease our costs, negatively impacting our business, results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to fully offset the effect of these increased costs\nthrough price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction programs.\n9\nTable of Contents\nWe rely on suppliers to produce or secure material required for the manufacture of our products. Production challenges at suppliers, a disruption in deliveries to or\nfrom suppliers or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or\nincrease our operating costs. On the other hand, in circumstances where demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience excess inventories and\nbe forced to incur additional costs and our profitability may suffer. Our business, competitive position, results of operations or financial condition could be\nnegatively impacted if supply is insufficient for our operations, if we experience excess inventories or if we are unable to adjust our production schedules or our\npurchases from suppliers to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations on a timely basis.\nChanges in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results. Most countries where our products and services are sold have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities, generally\nby adjusting interest rates. Interest rate changes affect overall economic growth, which affects demand for residential and nonresidential structures, as well as\nenergy and mined products, which in turn affects sales of our products and services that support these activities. Interest rate changes may also affect our\ncustomers’ ability to finance machine purchases, can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the\nproduction of parts and components necessary to manufacture and support our products. Increases in interest rates could negatively impact sales and create supply\nchain inefficiencies.\nCentral banks and other policy arms of many countries may take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available in an economy. The impact from a\nchange in liquidity and credit policies could negatively affect the customers and markets we serve or our suppliers, create supply chain inefficiencies and could\nadversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in monetary and fiscal policies, along with other factors, may cause currency exchange rates to fluctuate. Actions that lead the currency exchange rate of a\ncountry where we manufacture products to increase relative to other currencies could reduce the competitiveness of products made in that country, which could\nadversely affect our competitive position, results of operations and financial condition.\nGovernment policies on taxes and spending also affect our business. Throughout the world, government spending finances a significant portion of infrastructure\ndevelopment, such as highways, rail systems, airports, sewer and water systems, waterways and dams. Tax regulations determine asset depreciation lives and\nimpact the after-tax returns on business activity and investment, both of which influence investment decisions. Unfavorable developments, such as decisions to\nreduce public spending or to increase taxes, could negatively impact our results.\nOur global operations are exposed to political and economic risks, commercial instability and events beyond our control in the countries in which we\noperate.\nOur global operations are dependent upon products manufactured, purchased and sold in the U.S. and internationally, including in countries with political and\neconomic instability or uncertainty. This includes, for example, the uncertainty related to the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union (commonly\nknown as “Brexit”). Some countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than others. Our\nbusiness could be negatively impacted by adverse fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the\ntransportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products. Operating in different regions and countries exposes us\nto a number of risks, including: • multiple and potentially conflicting laws, regulations and policies that are subject to change; • imposition of currency restrictions, restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other restraints; • imposition of new or additional tariffs or quotas; • withdrawal from or modification of trade agreements or the negotiation of new trade agreements; • imposition of new or additional trade and economic sanctions laws imposed by the U.S. or foreign governments; • war or acts of terrorism; and\n• political and economic instability or civil unrest that may severely disrupt economic activity in affected countries.\n10\nTable of Contents\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to develop, produce and market quality products that meet our customers’ needs.\nOur business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to our\ndealers, OEMs and end-user customers. This is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to maintain key dealer relationships, our ability to produce\nproducts that meet the quality, performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs.\nIn addition, our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on leading-edge innovation, with respect to both products and\noperations, and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovations. Failure to continue to deliver high quality, innovative, competitive\nproducts to the marketplace, to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements, including\nengine exhaust emission requirements or to predict market demands for, or gain market acceptance of, our products, could have a negative impact on our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment, which could adversely affect our sales and pricing.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. We compete on the basis of a variety of factors, including product performance, customer service, quality and\nprice. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies’ products. Thus, our share of industry sales could be\nreduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties, our failure to price our\nproducts competitively, our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or an unexpected buildup in competitors’ new machine or dealer-owned rental\nfleets, which could lead to downward pressure on machine rental rates and/or used equipment prices.\nLack of customer acceptance of price increases we announce from time to time, changes in customer requirements for price discounts, changes in our customers’\nbehavior or a weak pricing environment could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, our results and ability to compete may be impacted negatively by changes in our geographic and product mix of sales.\nIncreased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services.\nWe rely upon information technology systems and networks, some of which are managed by third parties, in connection with a variety of business activities.\nAdditionally, we collect and store sensitive information relating to our business, customers, dealers, suppliers and employees. Operating these information\ntechnology systems and networks and processing and maintaining this data in a secure manner, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Information\ntechnology security threats -- from user error to cybersecurity attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems, networks and data -- are increasing in\nfrequency and sophistication. Cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crime\nand advanced persistent threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data.\nCybersecurity attacks could also include attacks targeting customer data or the security, integrity and/or reliability of the hardware and software installed in our\nproducts. It is possible that our information technology systems and networks, or those managed by third parties, could have vulnerabilities, which could go\nunnoticed for a period of time. While various procedures and controls have been and are being utilized to mitigate such risks, there can be no guarantee that the\nactions and controls we have implemented and are implementing, or which we cause or have caused third party service providers to implement, will be sufficient to\nprotect our systems, information or other property.\n11\nTable of Contents\nWe have experienced cyber security threats and vulnerabilities in our systems and those of our third party providers, and we have experienced viruses and attacks\ntargeting our information technology systems and networks. Such prior events, to date, have not had a material impact on our financial condition, results of\noperations or liquidity. However, the potential consequences of a future material cybersecurity attack include reputational damage, litigation with third parties,\ngovernment enforcement actions, penalties, disruption to systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, corruption of data,\ndiminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn\ncould adversely affect our competitiveness, results of operations and financial condition. Due to the evolving nature of such security threats, the potential impact of\nany future incident cannot be predicted. Further, the amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover claims or liabilities relating to a\ncybersecurity attack.\nIn addition, data we collect, store and process is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, such as the European Union's General Data\nProtection Regulation that became effective in May 2018, which may carry significant potential penalties for noncompliance.\nOur business is subject to the inventory management decisions and sourcing practices of our dealers and our OEM customers.\nWe sell finished products primarily through an independent dealer network and directly to OEMs and are subject to risks relating to their inventory management\ndecisions and operational and sourcing practices. Both carry inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on\ntheir assessments of future needs and market conditions, including levels of used equipment inventory and machine rental usage rates. Such adjustments may\nimpact our results positively or negatively. If the inventory levels of our dealers and OEM customers are higher than they desire, they may postpone product\npurchases from us, which could cause our sales to be lower than the end-user demand for our products and negatively impact our results. Similarly, our results\ncould be negatively impacted through the loss of time-sensitive sales if our dealers and OEM customers do not maintain inventory levels sufficient to meet\ncustomer demand.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures, or these benefits may take longer to realize than\nexpected.\nIn pursuing our business strategy, we routinely evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures. We often\ncompete with others for the same opportunities. To be successful, we conduct due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies, negotiate\ntransaction terms, complete complex transactions and manage post-closing matters such as the integration of acquired businesses. Further, while we seek to\nmitigate risks and liabilities of such transactions through due diligence, among other things, there may be risks and liabilities that our due diligence efforts fail to\ndiscover, that are not accurately or completely disclosed to us or that we inadequately assess. We may incur unanticipated costs or expenses following a completed\nacquisition, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation, and other liabilities. Risks\nassociated with our past or future acquisitions also include the following: • the failure to achieve the acquisition's revenue or profit forecast; • the business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture; • technological and product synergies, economies of scale and cost reductions may not occur as expected; • unforeseen expenses, delays or conditions may be imposed upon the acquisition, including due to required regulatory approvals or consents; • we may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities or be subject to unexpected penalties or other enforcement actions; • faulty assumptions may be made regarding the macroeconomic environment or the integration process; • unforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating operations, processes and systems; • higher than expected investments may be required to implement necessary compliance processes and related systems, including information technology\nsystems, accounting systems and internal controls over financial reporting; • we may fail to retain, motivate and integrate key management and other employees of the acquired business; • higher than expected costs may arise due to unforeseen changes in tax, trade, environmental, labor, safety, payroll or pension policies in any jurisdiction in\nwhich the acquired business conducts its operations; and\n12\nTable of Contents\n• we may experience problems in retaining customers and integrating customer bases.\nMany of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and\ndiversion of management’s time and attention. They may also delay the realization of the benefits we anticipate when we enter into a transaction.\nIn order to conserve cash for operations, we may undertake acquisitions financed in part through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities,\nor other arrangements. Such acquisition financing could result in a decrease in our earnings and adversely affect other leverage measures. If we issue equity\nsecurities or equity-linked securities, the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares.\nFailure to implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations. Furthermore, we make strategic divestitures from time to time. In the case of divestitures, we may agree to indemnify\nacquiring parties for certain liabilities arising from our former businesses. These divestitures may also result in continued financial involvement in the divested\nbusinesses following the transaction, including through guarantees or other financial arrangements. Lower performance by those divested businesses could affect\nour future financial results.\nUnion disputes or other labor matters could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nSome of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and\nexpiration dates. There can be no assurance that any current or future issues with our employees will be resolved or that we will not encounter future strikes, work\nstoppages or other disputes with labor unions or our employees. We may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the United\nStates and other countries when they expire. If we fail to renegotiate our existing collective bargaining agreements, we could encounter strikes or work stoppages\nor other disputes with labor unions. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at our facilities in the future.\nWe may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements. A work stoppage or other\nlimitations on production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition,\nmany of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces. Strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers could have an adverse\neffect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nUnexpected events may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations.\nThe occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including war, acts of terrorism or violence, civil unrest, fires, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes,\nfloods and other forms of severe weather in the United States or in other countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect\nour operations and financial performance. Natural disasters, pandemic illness, including the current COVID-19 outbreak, equipment failures, power outages or\nother unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers,\ntemporary or long-term disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers, and disruption and delay in the transport of our\nproducts to dealers, end-users and distribution centers. Existing insurance coverage may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events.\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nDisruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit our sources of liquidity, or the liquidity of our customers, dealers and suppliers.\nContinuing to meet our cash requirements over the long-term requires substantial liquidity and access to varied sources of funds, including capital and credit\nmarkets. Global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. Market volatility, changes in counterparty credit risk,\nthe impact of government intervention in financial markets and general economic conditions may also adversely impact our ability to access capital and credit\nmarkets to fund operating needs. Global or regional economic downturns could cause financial markets to decrease the availability of liquidity, credit and credit\ncapacity for certain issuers, including certain customers, dealers and suppliers. An inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position. Furthermore, changes in global economic conditions, including material cost increases\nand decreases in economic activity in key markets we serve, and the success of plans to manage cost increases, inventory and other important elements of our\nbusiness may significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations.\n13\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, demand for our products generally depends on customers’ ability to pay for our products, which, in turn, depends on their access to funds. Changes in\nglobal economic conditions may result in customers experiencing increased difficulty in generating funds from operations. Capital and credit market volatility and\nuncertainty may cause financial institutions to revise their lending standards, resulting in customers’ decreased access to capital. If capital and credit market\nvolatility occurs, customers’ liquidity may decline which, in turn, would reduce their ability to purchase our products.\nFailure to maintain our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position\nand access to capital markets.\nEach of Caterpillar’s and Cat Financial’s costs of borrowing and their respective ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but\nalso by the short- and long-term credit ratings assigned to their respective debt by the major credit rating agencies. These ratings are based, in significant part, on\neach of Caterpillar’s and Cat Financial’s performance as measured by financial metrics such as net worth, interest coverage and leverage ratios, as well as\ntransparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. There can be no assurance that Caterpillar and Cat Financial will be able to maintain their\ncredit ratings. We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies. Moody’s\nlong- and short-term ratings of Caterpillar and Cat Financial are A3 and Prime-2 (“low-A”), while other major credit rating agencies maintain a “mid-A” debt\nrating. A downgrade of our credit rating by any of the major credit rating agencies would result in increased borrowing costs and could adversely affect\nCaterpillar’s and Cat Financial’s liquidity, competitive position and access to the capital markets, including restricting, in whole or in part, access to the\ncommercial paper market. There can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will continue to be a reliable source of short-term financing for Cat\nFinancial or an available source of short-term financing for Caterpillar. An inability to access the capital markets could have an adverse effect on our cash flow,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nOur Financial Products segment is subject to risks associated with the financial services industry.\nCat Financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support for a significant share of our global sales. The inability of Cat Financial to access\nfunds to support its financing activities to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nContinuing to meet Cat Financial's cash requirements over the long-term could require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds, including capital and\ncredit markets. Cat Financial has continued to maintain access to key global medium term note and commercial paper markets, but there can be no assurance that\nsuch markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing. If global economic conditions were to deteriorate, Cat Financial could face materially higher\nfinancing costs, become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow its business and/or meet its debt service obligations as they mature, and be required\nto draw upon contractually committed lending agreements and/or seek other funding sources. However, there can be no assurance that such agreements and other\nfunding sources would be available or sufficient under extreme market conditions. Any of these events could negatively impact Cat Financial’s business, as well as\nour and Cat Financial's results of operations and financial condition.\nMarket disruption and volatility may also lead to a number of other risks in connection with these events, including but not limited to: • Market developments that may affect customer confidence levels and cause declines in the demand for financing and adverse changes in payment\npatterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could impact Cat Financial’s write-offs and provision for credit losses. • The process Cat Financial uses to estimate losses inherent in its credit exposure requires a high degree of management’s judgment regarding numerous\nsubjective qualitative factors, including forecasts of economic conditions and how economic predictors might impair the ability of its borrowers to repay\ntheir loans. Financial market disruption and volatility may impact the accuracy of these judgments. • Cat Financial’s ability to engage in routine funding transactions or borrow from other financial institutions on acceptable terms or at all could be adversely\naffected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations. • As Cat Financial’s lending agreements are primarily with financial institutions, their ability to perform in accordance with any of its underlying\nagreements could be adversely affected by market volatility and/or disruptions in financial markets.\n14\nTable of Contents\nChanges in interest rates or market liquidity conditions could adversely affect Cat Financial's and our earnings and/or cash flow.\nChanges in interest rates and market liquidity conditions could have an adverse impact on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows. Because a significant\nnumber of the loans made by Cat Financial are made at fixed interest rates, its business results are subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Certain loans made by\nCat Financial and various financing extended to Cat Financial are made at variable rates that use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. LIBOR\nis the subject of recent proposals for reform. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or\ncompelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. These reforms may cause LIBOR to cease to exist, new methods of calculating LIBOR to be established such\nthat LIBOR continues to exist after 2021 or the establishment of an alternative reference rate(s). Several offerings of securities that include such an alternative\nreference rate have now been completed by other companies. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse\nimpact on the market value for or value of LIBOR-linked securities, loans, derivatives, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to Cat\nFinancial, as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those securities, loans and financial instruments. Cat Financial has created a cross-functional team\nthat will assess risk across multiple categories as it relates to the use of LIBOR in securities, loans, derivatives, and other financial obligations or extensions of\ncredit held by or due to us. The team is also closely monitoring the progress of LIBOR reform and preparing to incorporate appropriate fallback language for\ntransitioning to an alternative reference rate(s) into new agreements with customers. The team is reviewing how to best manage those customer agreements that\nextend beyond 2021 and utilize LIBOR. Other changes in market interest rates may influence Cat Financial’s borrowing costs and could reduce its and our\nearnings and cash flows, returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts. Cat Financial manages interest rate and market liquidity risks\nthrough a variety of techniques that include a match funding strategy, the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program. There can be no\nassurance, however, that fluctuations in interest rates and market liquidity conditions will not have an adverse impact on its and our earnings and cash flows. If any\nof the variety of instruments and strategies Cat Financial uses to hedge its exposure to these types of risk is ineffective, this may have an adverse impact on our\nearnings and cash flows. With respect to Insurance Services' investment activities, changes in the equity and bond markets could result in a decline in value of its\ninvestment portfolio, resulting in an unfavorable impact to earnings.\nAn increase in delinquencies, repossessions or net losses of Cat Financial customers could adversely affect its results.\nInherent in the operation of Cat Financial is the credit risk associated with its customers. The creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies,\nrepossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors, including relevant industry and economic conditions, the availability\nof capital, the experience and expertise of the customer's management team, commodity prices, political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral.\nAny increase in delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations could have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and\ncash flows. In addition, although Cat Financial evaluates and adjusts its allowance for credit losses related to past due and non-performing receivables on a regular\nbasis, adverse economic conditions or other factors that might cause deterioration of the financial health of its customers could change the timing and level of\npayments received and necessitate an increase in Cat Financial's estimated losses, which could also have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our\nearnings and cash flows.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations.\nWe conduct operations in many countries involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent\nthat our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates have had, and will continue to\nhave, an impact on our results as expressed in U.S. dollars. There can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results\nof operations, financial condition and cash flows. While the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in\ncurrency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nIn addition, our outlooks do not assume fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates from the date of our outlooks\ncould cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in our outlooks and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nWe also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign\ncurrencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing\ncontrols. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation.\n15\nTable of Contents\nRestrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility.\nWe maintain a number of credit facilities to support general corporate purposes (facilities) and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations\n(debt securities). The agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain\nsubsidiaries, including Cat Financial. These covenants include maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth (defined as the consolidated shareholder’s equity\nincluding preferred stock but excluding the pension and other post-retirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)), limitations\non the incurrence of liens and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger. Cat Financial has also agreed under certain of these agreements not to exceed a\ncertain leverage ratio (consolidated debt to consolidated net worth, calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day\nof each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each December 31), to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio (profit excluding income taxes, interest\nexpense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to interest expense, calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then\nmost recently ended) and not to terminate, amend or modify its support agreement with us.\nA breach of one or more of the covenants could result in adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition. These consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities, triggering of an obligation to redeem certain\ndebt securities, termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders, refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to\nenter into new facilities or the lowering or modification of our credit ratings or those of one or more of our subsidiaries.\nSustained increases in funding obligations under our pension plans may impair our liquidity or financial condition.\nWe maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for our employees, which impose on us certain funding obligations. In determining our future payment\nobligations under the plans, we assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and a certain level of future benefit payments. Significant adverse changes in credit\nor capital markets could result in actual rates of return being materially lower than projected and result in increased contribution requirements. Our assumptions\nfor future benefit payments may also change over time and could be materially higher than originally projected. We expect to make contributions to our pension\nplans in the future, and may be required to make contributions that could be material. We may fund contributions through the use of cash on hand, the proceeds of\nborrowings, shares of our common stock or a combination of the foregoing, as permitted by applicable law. Our assumptions for future benefit payments may\nchange over time and could be materially higher than projected. These factors could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans, and as a result,\nadversely affect our business and overall financial condition.\nLEGAL & REGULATORY RISKS\nOur global operations are subject to a wide-range of trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations.\nDue to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations\nissued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Antiboycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls\nand the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries. Any alleged or actual violations may subject us to\nincreased government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services\noutside the United States. Furthermore, embargoes and sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales to specific persons or\ncountries or based on product classification may expose us to potential criminal and civil sanctions. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future\nregulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or in certain locations the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nIn addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making\nimproper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or\nobtaining an unfair advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Our operations outside the United\nStates, including in developing countries, expose us to the the risk of such violations. Violations of anti-corruption laws or regulations by our employees,\nintermediaries acting on our behalf, or our joint venture partners may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse\neffect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.\n16\nTable of Contents\nInternational trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position.\nGovernment policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas, capital controls or tariffs, whether adopted by individual governments or\naddressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being\nable to sell products in certain countries. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs or new barriers to\nentry, in countries where we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. For\nexample, a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results\nof operations.\nWe may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the\neffective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings between U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions or among jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates,\nchanges in our overall profitability, changes in tax laws or treaties or in their application or interpretation, changes in tax rates, changes in generally accepted\naccounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested in certain non-U.S.\njurisdictions, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures. We are also subject to the\ncontinuous examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse\noutcome resulting from these examinations. If our effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess\nof amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. For information regarding additional legal\nmatters related to our taxes, please see Note 6 — “Income taxes” and Note 22 — “Environmental and legal matters” of Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data” to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Costs associated with lawsuits or investigations or adverse rulings in enforcement or other legal proceedings may have an adverse effect on our results of\noperations.\nWe are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in virtually every part of the world. We face risk of exposure to various types of claims,\nlawsuits and government investigations. We are involved in various claims and lawsuits related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including\nclaimed asbestos exposure), contracts, employment issues, environmental matters, intellectual property rights, tax, securities and other legal proceedings that arise\nin and outside of the ordinary course of our business. The industries in which we operate are also periodically reviewed or investigated by regulators, which could\nlead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims. It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims,\ninvestigations and lawsuits, and we could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an\nadverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations or financial condition in any particular period.\nThe global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other\ncontingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time. In addition, subsequent developments in legal proceedings\nmay affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have\nan adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.\nNew regulations or changes in financial services regulation could adversely impact Caterpillar and Cat Financial.\nCat Financial’s operations are highly regulated by governmental authorities in the locations where it operates, which can impose significant additional costs and/or\nrestrictions on its business. In the United States, for example, certain Cat Financial activities are subject to the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act (Dodd-Frank), which includes extensive provisions regulating the financial services industry. As a result, Cat Financial has become and could\ncontinue to become subject to additional regulatory costs that could be significant and have an adverse effect on Cat Financial’s and our results of operations and\nfinancial condition. Changes in regulations or additional regulations in the United States or internationally impacting the financial services industry could also add\nsignificant cost or operational constraints that might have an adverse effect on Cat Financial’s and our results of operations and financial condition.\n17\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs.\nOur facilities, operations and products are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations globally, including laws and regulations governing\nemissions to noise, air, releases to soil and discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of non-hazardous and\nhazardous waste materials. Some environmental laws impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous\nsubstances, even for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred, or for the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators, predecessors or other third\nparties. Failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to penalties or clean-up costs, civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our\nactivities, as well as damage to property or natural resources. The potential liabilities, sanctions, damages and remediation efforts related to any non-compliance\nwith such laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there\ncan be no assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under\npresent laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations may change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. Changes in environmental laws or\nregulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to environmental laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our\noperations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations,\nincluding laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance\nexpenditures. Changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs\nand restrictions, including increased energy and raw materials costs.

In addition, the statements in this section and other sections of this Form 10-K, including in\nPart II, Item 7 “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” include “forward-looking statements” as that term is\ndefined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results. Forward-looking statements give\ncurrent expectations or forecasts of future events about the company or our outlook. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact they do not relate to\nhistorical or current facts and by the use of words such as “believe,” “expect,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “will be,” “should,” “plan,” “forecast,” “target,” “guide,”\n“project,” “intend,” “could” and similar words or expressions.\nForward-looking statements are based on assumptions and on known risks and uncertainties. Although we believe we have been prudent in our assumptions, any or\nall of our forward-looking statements may prove to be inaccurate, and we can make no guarantees about our future performance. Should known or unknown risks\nor uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could materially differ from past results and/or those anticipated, estimated or\nprojected.\nWe undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should,\nhowever, consult any subsequent disclosures we make in our filings with the SEC on Form 10-Q or Form 8-K.\nThe following is a cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are material to our business. In addition to the factors discussed\nelsewhere in this report, the following are some of the important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we believe could make our actual results differ\nmaterially from those described in any forward-looking statements. It is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and, as a result, you should not consider the\nfollowing factors to be a complete discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nCOVID-19 was identified in late 2019 and has spread globally. The rapid spread has resulted in weaker demand and constrained supply and the implementation of\nnumerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders and shutdowns. These factors have impacted\nand may continue to impact all or portions of our workforce and operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused a global recession and it is uncertain when a sustained economic recovery may occur. The COVID-19 pandemic has also\nsignificantly increased economic and demand uncertainty and has led to a decrease in demand for the Company’s products and services and caused supply chain\ndisruptions. Economic uncertainties could continue to affect demand for the Company’s products and services, the value of the equipment financed or leased, the\ndemand for financing and the financial condition and credit risk of our dealers and customers.\nUncertainties related to the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including new strains, may significantly adversely affect our business. These\nuncertainties include: the duration and impact of the resurgence in COVID-19 cases in any country, state, or region; prolonged reduction or closure of the\nCompany’s operations, or a delayed recovery in our operations; disruptions in the supply chain; increased logistics costs; the impact of the pandemic on the\nCompany’s customers and dealers; the impact of disruptions in the global capital markets and/or declines in our financial performance or credit ratings, which could\nimpact the Company’s ability to obtain funding in the future; and the impact of the pandemic on demand for our products and services as discussed above. It is\nunclear when a sustained economic recovery could occur and what a recovery may look like. All of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business,\nresults of operations and/or financial condition.\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s financial and operational results will be determined by the length of time that the pandemic\ncontinues, its effect on the demand for the Company’s products and services and the supply chain, as well as the effect of governmental regulations imposed in\nresponse to the pandemic. The overall magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic and the continued fluidity of the situation could materially and adversely impact our\nbusiness, results of operations and/or financial condition.\n10\nTable of Contents\nMACROECONOMIC RISKS\nOur business and the industries we serve are highly sensitive to global and regional economic conditions.\nOur results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions globally and regionally and in the particular industries we serve. The demand for our\nproducts and services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in periods of economic weakness characterized by lower levels of government and\nbusiness investment, lower levels of business confidence, lower corporate earnings, high real interest rates, lower credit activity or tighter credit conditions,\nperceived or actual industry overcapacity, higher unemployment and lower consumer spending. A prolonged period of economic weakness may also result in\nincreased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges. Economic conditions vary across regions\nand countries, and demand for our products and services generally increases in those regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment. Slower\neconomic growth or a change in the global mix of regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe energy, transportation and mining industries are major users of our products, including the coal, iron ore, gold, copper, oil and natural gas industries.\nCustomers in these industries frequently base their decisions to purchase our products and services on the expected future performance of these industries, which in\nturn are dependent in part on commodity prices. Prices of commodities in these industries are frequently volatile and can change abruptly and unpredictably in\nresponse to general economic conditions and trends, government actions, regulatory actions, commodity inventories, production and consumption levels,\ntechnological innovations, commodity substitutions, market expectations and any disruptions in production or distribution or changes in consumption. Economic\nconditions affecting the industries we serve may in the future also lead to reduced capital expenditures by our customers. Reduced capital expenditures by our\ncustomers are likely to lead to a decrease in the demand for our products and services and may also result in a decrease in demand for aftermarket parts as customers\nare likely to extend preventative maintenance schedules and delay major overhauls when possible.\nThe rates of infrastructure spending, commercial construction and housing starts also play a significant role in our results. Our products are an integral component\nof these activities, and as these activities decrease, demand for our products may be significantly impacted, which could negatively impact our results.\nCommodity price changes, material price increases, fluctuations in demand for our products, significant disruptions to our supply chains or significant\nshortages of material may adversely impact our financial results or our ability to meet commitments to customers.\nWe are a significant user of steel and many other commodities required for the manufacture of our products. Increases in the prices of such commodities would\nincrease our costs, negatively impacting our business, results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to fully offset the effect of these increased costs\nthrough price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction programs.\nWe rely on suppliers to produce or secure material required for the manufacture of our products. Production challenges at suppliers (including suppliers of\nsemiconductors), a disruption in deliveries to or from suppliers or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability\nto meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. On the other hand, in circumstances where demand for our products is less than we expect,\nwe may experience excess inventories and be forced to incur additional costs and our profitability may suffer. Additionally, we have experienced and expect to\ncontinue to experience transportation delays for parts, components and finished machines due to significant demands in global transportation and congestion at ports\nthroughout the globe. Our business, competitive position, results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted if supply is insufficient for our\noperations, if significant transportation delays interfere with deliveries, if we experience excess inventories or if we are unable to adjust our production schedules or\nour purchases from suppliers to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations on a timely basis.\nChanges in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results. Most countries where our products and services are sold have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities, generally by\nadjusting interest rates. Interest rate changes affect overall economic growth, which affects demand for residential and nonresidential structures, as well as energy\nand mined products, which in turn affects sales of our products and services that support these activities. Interest rate changes may also affect our customers’ ability\nto finance machine purchases, can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production of parts\nand components necessary to manufacture and support our products. Increases in interest rates could negatively impact sales and create supply chain inefficiencies.\n11\nTable of Contents\nCentral banks and other policy arms of many countries may take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available in an economy. The impact from a\nchange in liquidity and credit policies could negatively affect the customers and markets we serve or our suppliers, create supply chain inefficiencies and could\nadversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in monetary and fiscal policies, along with other factors, may cause currency exchange rates to fluctuate. Actions that lead the currency exchange rate of a\ncountry where we manufacture products to increase relative to other currencies could reduce the competitiveness of products made in that country, which could\nadversely affect our competitive position, results of operations and financial condition.\nGovernment policies on taxes and spending also affect our business. Throughout the world, government spending finances a significant portion of infrastructure\ndevelopment, such as highways, rail systems, airports, sewer and water systems, waterways and dams. Tax regulations determine asset depreciation lives and\nimpact the after-tax returns on business activity and investment, both of which influence investment decisions. Unfavorable developments, such as decisions to\nreduce public spending or to increase taxes, could negatively impact our results.\nOur global operations are exposed to political and economic risks, commercial instability and events beyond our control in the countries in which we\noperate.\nOur global operations are dependent upon products manufactured, purchased and sold in the U.S. and internationally, including in countries with political and\neconomic instability or uncertainty. Some countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions\nthan others. Our business could be negatively impacted by adverse fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions\nin the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products. Operating in different regions and countries\nexposes us to a number of risks, including: • multiple and potentially conflicting laws, regulations and policies that are subject to change; • imposition of currency restrictions, restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other restraints; • imposition of new or additional tariffs or quotas; • withdrawal from or modification of trade agreements or the negotiation of new trade agreements; • imposition of new or additional trade and economic sanctions laws imposed by the U.S. or foreign governments; • war or acts of terrorism; and\n• political and economic instability or civil unrest that may severely disrupt economic activity in affected countries.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to develop, produce and market quality products that meet our customers’ needs.\nOur business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to our\ndealers, OEMs and end-user customers. This is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to maintain key dealer relationships, our ability to produce\nproducts that meet the quality, performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs.\nIn addition, our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on leading-edge innovation, with respect to both products and\noperations, and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovations. Failure to continue to deliver high quality, innovative, competitive\nproducts to the marketplace, to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements, including engine\nexhaust emission requirements or to predict market demands for, or gain market acceptance of, our products, could have a negative impact on our business, results\nof operations and financial condition.\n12\nTable of Contents\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment, which could adversely affect our sales and pricing.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. We compete on the basis of a variety of factors, including product performance, customer service, quality and\nprice. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies’ products. Thus, our share of industry sales could be\nreduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties, our failure to price our products\ncompetitively, our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or an unexpected buildup in competitors’ new machine or dealer-owned rental fleets, which\ncould lead to downward pressure on machine rental rates and/or used equipment prices.\nLack of customer acceptance of price increases we announce from time to time, changes in customer requirements for price discounts, changes in our customers’\nbehavior or a weak pricing environment could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, our results and ability to compete may be impacted negatively by changes in our geographic and product mix of sales.\nIncreased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services.\nWe rely upon information technology systems and networks, some of which are managed by third parties, in connection with a variety of business activities.\nAdditionally, we collect and store sensitive information relating to our business, customers, dealers, suppliers and employees. Operating these information\ntechnology systems and networks and processing and maintaining this data in a secure manner, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Information\ntechnology security threats -- from user error to cybersecurity attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems, networks and data -- are increasing in\nfrequency and sophistication. Cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crime\nand advanced persistent threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data.\nCybersecurity attacks could also include attacks targeting customer data or the security, integrity and/or reliability of the hardware and software installed in our\nproducts. It is possible that our information technology systems and networks, or those managed or provided by third parties, could have vulnerabilities, which\ncould go unnoticed for a period of time. While various procedures and controls have been and are being utilized to mitigate such risks, there can be no guarantee\nthat the actions and controls we have implemented and are implementing, or which we cause or have caused third party service providers to implement, will be\nsufficient to protect our systems, information or other property.\nWe have experienced cyber security threats and vulnerabilities in our systems and those of our third party providers, and we have experienced viruses and attacks\ntargeting our information technology systems and networks. Such prior events, to date, have not had a material impact on our financial condition, results of\noperations or liquidity. However, the potential consequences of a future material cybersecurity attack include reputational damage, litigation with third parties,\ngovernment enforcement actions, penalties, disruption to systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, corruption of data,\ndiminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn\ncould adversely affect our competitiveness, results of operations and financial condition. Due to the evolving nature of such security threats, the potential impact of\nany future incident cannot be predicted. Further, the amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover claims or liabilities relating to a\ncybersecurity attack.\nIn addition, data we collect, store and process is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, such as the European Union's General Data\nProtection Regulation that became effective in May 2018, which may carry significant potential penalties for noncompliance.\n13\nTable of Contents\nOur business is subject to the inventory management decisions and sourcing practices of our dealers and our OEM customers.\nWe sell finished products primarily through an independent dealer network and directly to OEMs and are subject to risks relating to their inventory management\ndecisions and operational and sourcing practices. Both carry inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on\ntheir assessments of future needs and market conditions, including levels of used equipment inventory and machine rental usage rates. Such adjustments may\nimpact our results positively or negatively. If the inventory levels of our dealers and OEM customers are higher than they desire, they may postpone product\npurchases from us, which could cause our sales to be lower than the end-user demand for our products and negatively impact our results. Similarly, our results could\nbe negatively impacted through the loss of time-sensitive sales if our dealers and OEM customers do not maintain inventory levels sufficient to meet customer\ndemand.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures, or these benefits may take longer to realize than\nexpected.\nIn pursuing our business strategy, we routinely evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures. We often\ncompete with others for the same opportunities. To be successful, we conduct due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies, negotiate\ntransaction terms, complete complex transactions and manage post-closing matters such as the integration of acquired businesses. Further, while we seek to mitigate\nrisks and liabilities of such transactions through due diligence, among other things, there may be risks and liabilities that our due diligence efforts fail to discover,\nthat are not accurately or completely disclosed to us or that we inadequately assess. We may incur unanticipated costs or expenses following a completed\nacquisition, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation, and other liabilities. Risks\nassociated with our past or future acquisitions also include the following: • the failure to achieve the acquisition's revenue or profit forecast; • the business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture; • technological and product synergies, economies of scale and cost reductions may not occur as expected; • unforeseen expenses, delays or conditions may be imposed upon the acquisition, including due to required regulatory approvals or consents; • we may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities or be subject to unexpected penalties or other enforcement actions; • faulty assumptions may be made regarding the macroeconomic environment or the integration process; • unforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating operations, processes and systems; • higher than expected investments may be required to implement necessary compliance processes and related systems, including information technology\nsystems, accounting systems and internal controls over financial reporting; • we may fail to retain, motivate and integrate key management and other employees of the acquired business; • higher than expected costs may arise due to unforeseen changes in tax, trade, environmental, labor, safety, payroll or pension policies in any jurisdiction in\nwhich the acquired business conducts its operations; and\n• we may experience problems in retaining customers and integrating customer bases.\nMany of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion\nof management’s time and attention. They may also delay the realization of the benefits we anticipate when we enter into a transaction.\nIn order to conserve cash for operations, we may undertake acquisitions financed in part through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities,\nor other arrangements. Such acquisition financing could result in a decrease in our earnings and adversely affect other leverage measures. If we issue equity\nsecurities or equity-linked securities, the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares.\n14\nTable of Contents\nFailure to implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations. Furthermore, we make strategic divestitures from time to time. In the case of divestitures, we may agree to indemnify acquiring\nparties for certain liabilities arising from our former businesses. These divestitures may also result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses\nfollowing the transaction, including through guarantees or other financial arrangements. Lower performance by those divested businesses could affect our future\nfinancial results.\nUnion disputes or other labor matters could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nSome of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and\nexpiration dates. There can be no assurance that any current or future issues with our employees will be resolved or that we will not encounter future strikes, work\nstoppages or other disputes with labor unions or our employees. We may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the United\nStates and other countries when they expire. If we fail to renegotiate our existing collective bargaining agreements, we could encounter strikes or work stoppages or\nother disputes with labor unions. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at our facilities in the future. We\nmay also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements. A work stoppage or other limitations\non production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, many of our\ncustomers and suppliers have unionized work forces. Strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers could have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\nUnexpected events may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations.\nThe occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including war, acts of terrorism or violence, civil unrest, fires, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes,\nfloods and other forms of severe weather in the United States or in other countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect\nour operations and financial performance. Natural disasters, pandemic illness, including the current COVID-19 outbreak, equipment failures, power outages or\nother unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers,\ntemporary or long-term disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers, and disruption and delay in the transport of our\nproducts to dealers, end-users and distribution centers. Existing insurance coverage may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events.\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nDisruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit our sources of liquidity, or the liquidity of our customers, dealers and suppliers.\nContinuing to meet our cash requirements over the long-term requires substantial liquidity and access to varied sources of funds, including capital and credit\nmarkets. Global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. Market volatility, changes in counterparty credit risk, the\nimpact of government intervention in financial markets and general economic conditions may also adversely impact our ability to access capital and credit markets\nto fund operating needs. Global or regional economic downturns could cause financial markets to decrease the availability of liquidity, credit and credit capacity for\ncertain issuers, including certain customers, dealers and suppliers. An inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business,\nresults of operations, financial condition and competitive position. Furthermore, changes in global economic conditions, including material cost increases and\ndecreases in economic activity in key markets we serve, and the success of plans to manage cost increases, inventory and other important elements of our business\nmay significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations.\nIn addition, demand for our products generally depends on customers’ ability to pay for our products, which, in turn, depends on their access to funds. Changes in\nglobal economic conditions may result in customers experiencing increased difficulty in generating funds from operations. Capital and credit market volatility and\nuncertainty may cause financial institutions to revise their lending standards, resulting in customers’ decreased access to capital. If capital and credit market\nvolatility occurs, customers’ liquidity may decline which, in turn, would reduce their ability to purchase our products.\n15\nTable of Contents\nFailure to maintain our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and\naccess to capital markets.\nEach of Caterpillar’s and Cat Financial’s costs of borrowing and their respective ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but\nalso by the short- and long-term credit ratings assigned to their respective debt by the major credit rating agencies. These ratings are based, in significant part, on\neach of Caterpillar’s and Cat Financial’s performance as measured by financial metrics such as net worth, interest coverage and leverage ratios, as well as\ntransparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. There can be no assurance that Caterpillar and Cat Financial will be able to maintain their\ncredit ratings. We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies. Moody’s\nlong- and short-term ratings of Caterpillar and Cat Financial are A3 and Prime-2 (“low-A”), while other major credit rating agencies maintain a “mid-A” debt rating.\nA downgrade of our credit rating by any of the major credit rating agencies would result in increased borrowing costs and could adversely affect Caterpillar’s and\nCat Financial’s liquidity, competitive position and access to the capital markets, including restricting, in whole or in part, access to the commercial paper market.\nThere can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will continue to be a reliable source of short-term financing for Cat Financial or an available source of\nshort-term financing for Caterpillar. An inability to access the capital markets could have an adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nOur Financial Products segment is subject to risks associated with the financial services industry.\nCat Financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support for a significant share of our global sales. The inability of Cat Financial to access funds\nto support its financing activities to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nContinuing to meet Cat Financial's cash requirements over the long-term could require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds, including capital and\ncredit markets. Cat Financial has continued to maintain access to key global medium term note and commercial paper markets, but there can be no assurance that\nsuch markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing. If global economic conditions were to deteriorate, Cat Financial could face materially higher\nfinancing costs, become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow its business and/or meet its debt service obligations as they mature, and be required\nto draw upon contractually committed lending agreements and/or seek other funding sources. However, there can be no assurance that such agreements and other\nfunding sources would be available or sufficient under extreme market conditions. Any of these events could negatively impact Cat Financial’s business, as well as\nour and Cat Financial's results of operations and financial condition.\nMarket disruption and volatility may also lead to a number of other risks in connection with these events, including but not limited to: • Market developments that may affect customer confidence levels and cause declines in the demand for financing and adverse changes in payment patterns,\ncausing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could impact Cat Financial’s write-offs and provision for credit losses. • The process Cat Financial uses to estimate losses inherent in its credit exposure requires a high degree of management’s judgment regarding numerous\nsubjective qualitative factors, including forecasts of economic conditions and how economic predictors might impair the ability of its borrowers to repay\ntheir loans. Financial market disruption and volatility may impact the accuracy of these judgments. • Cat Financial’s ability to engage in routine funding transactions or borrow from other financial institutions on acceptable terms or at all could be adversely\naffected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations. • As Cat Financial’s lending agreements are primarily with financial institutions, their ability to perform in accordance with any of its underlying agreements\ncould be adversely affected by market volatility and/or disruptions in financial markets.\n16\nTable of Contents\nChanges in interest rates or market liquidity conditions could adversely affect Cat Financial's and our earnings and/or cash flow.\nChanges in interest rates and market liquidity conditions could have an adverse impact on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows. Because a significant\nnumber of the loans made by Cat Financial are made at fixed interest rates, its business results are subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Certain loans made by Cat\nFinancial and various financing extended to Cat Financial are made at variable rates that use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. LIBOR is the\nsubject of recent proposals for reform. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\") announced that it intends to stop persuading\nor compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. On November 18, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration (\"IBA\"), the administrator of USD LIBOR,\nannounced plans to consult on its intention to cease the publication of all GBP, EUR, CHF and JPY LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication\non December 31, 2021. On November 30, 2020, IBA, with the support of the United States Federal Reserve and the FCA, announced plans to consult on ceasing\npublication of USD LIBOR on December 31, 2021 for only the one week and two month USD LIBOR tenors, and on June 30, 2023 for all other USD LIBOR\ntenors. While the November 30th announcement extends the transition period to June 2023, the United States Federal Reserve concurrently issued a statement\nadvising banks to stop new USD LIBOR issuances by the end of 2021. These reforms may cause LIBOR to cease to exist, new methods of calculating LIBOR to be\nestablished such that LIBOR continues to exist after 2021 or the establishment of an alternative reference rate(s). Several offerings of securities that include such an\nalternative reference rate have now been completed by other companies. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted and could have an\nadverse impact on the market value for or value of LIBOR-linked securities, loans, derivatives, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due\nto Cat Financial, as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those securities, loans and financial instruments. Cat Financial has created a cross-functional\nteam that will assess risk across multiple categories as it relates to the use of LIBOR in securities, loans, derivatives, and other financial obligations or extensions of\ncredit held by or due to us. Other changes in market interest rates may influence Cat Financial’s borrowing costs and could reduce its and our earnings and cash\nflows, returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts. Cat Financial manages interest rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of\ntechniques that include a match funding strategy, the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program. There can be no assurance, however,\nthat fluctuations in interest rates and market liquidity conditions will not have an adverse impact on its and our earnings and cash flows. If any of the variety of\ninstruments and strategies Cat Financial uses to hedge its exposure to these types of risk is ineffective, this may have an adverse impact on our earnings and cash\nflows. With respect to Insurance Services' investment activities, changes in the equity and bond markets could result in a decline in value of its investment\nportfolio, resulting in an unfavorable impact to earnings.\nAn increase in delinquencies, repossessions or net losses of Cat Financial customers could adversely affect its results.\nInherent in the operation of Cat Financial is the credit risk associated with its customers. The creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies,\nrepossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors, including relevant industry and economic conditions, the availability\nof capital, the experience and expertise of the customer's management team, commodity prices, political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral.\nAny increase in delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations could have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and\ncash flows. In addition, although Cat Financial evaluates and adjusts its allowance for credit losses related to past due and non-performing receivables on a regular\nbasis, adverse economic conditions or other factors that might cause deterioration of the financial health of its customers could change the timing and level of\npayments received and necessitate an increase in Cat Financial's estimated losses, which could also have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our\nearnings and cash flows.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations.\nWe conduct operations in many countries involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent\nthat our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates have had, and will continue to\nhave, an impact on our results as expressed in U.S. dollars. There can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results\nof operations, financial condition and cash flows. While the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in\ncurrency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates. In\naddition, our outlooks do not assume fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates from the date of our outlooks could\ncause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in our outlooks and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n17\nTable of Contents\nWe also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies\ninto U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls.\nCurrency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation.\nRestrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility.\nWe maintain a number of credit facilities to support general corporate purposes (facilities) and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations\n(debt securities). The agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain\nsubsidiaries, including Cat Financial. These covenants include maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth (defined as the consolidated shareholder’s equity\nincluding preferred stock but excluding the pension and other post-retirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)), limitations\non the incurrence of liens and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger. Cat Financial has also agreed under certain of these agreements not to exceed a\ncertain leverage ratio (consolidated debt to consolidated net worth, calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day\nof each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each December 31), to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio (profit excluding income taxes, interest\nexpense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to interest expense, calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then\nmost recently ended) and not to terminate, amend or modify its support agreement with us.\nA breach of one or more of the covenants could result in adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition. These consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities, triggering of an obligation to redeem certain debt\nsecurities, termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders, refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to enter\ninto new facilities or the lowering or modification of our credit ratings or those of one or more of our subsidiaries.\nSustained increases in funding obligations under our pension plans may impair our liquidity or financial condition.\nWe maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for our employees, which impose on us certain funding obligations. In determining our future payment\nobligations under the plans, we assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and a certain level of future benefit payments. Significant adverse changes in credit\nor capital markets could result in actual rates of return being materially lower than projected and result in increased contribution requirements. Our assumptions for\nfuture benefit payments may also change over time and could be materially higher than originally projected. We expect to make contributions to our pension plans\nin the future, and may be required to make contributions that could be material. We may fund contributions through the use of cash on hand, the proceeds of\nborrowings, shares of our common stock or a combination of the foregoing, as permitted by applicable law. Our assumptions for future benefit payments may\nchange over time and could be materially higher than projected. These factors could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans, and as a result,\nadversely affect our business and overall financial condition.\nLEGAL & REGULATORY RISKS\nOur global operations are subject to a wide-range of trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations.\nDue to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations\nissued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Antiboycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls\nand the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries. Any alleged or actual violations may subject us to\nincreased government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services\noutside the United States. Furthermore, embargoes and sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales to specific persons or\ncountries or based on product classification may expose us to potential criminal and civil sanctions. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future\nregulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or in certain locations the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\n18\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making\nimproper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or\nobtaining an unfair advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Our operations outside the United\nStates, including in developing countries, expose us to the risk of such violations. Violations of anti-corruption laws or regulations by our employees, intermediaries\nacting on our behalf, or our joint venture partners may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our\nreputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.\nInternational trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position.\nGovernment policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas, capital controls or tariffs, whether adopted by individual governments or\naddressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being\nable to sell products in certain countries. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs or new barriers to\nentry, in countries where we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. For\nexample, a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results\nof operations.\nWe may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the\neffective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings between U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions or among jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates,\nchanges in our overall profitability, changes in tax laws or treaties or in their application or interpretation, changes in tax rates, changes in generally accepted\naccounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested in certain non-U.S.\njurisdictions, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures. We are also subject to the\ncontinuous examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse\noutcome resulting from these examinations. If our effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess\nof amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. For information regarding additional legal\nmatters related to our taxes, please see Note 6 — “Income taxes” and Note 22 — “Environmental and legal matters” of Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data” to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Costs associated with lawsuits or investigations or adverse rulings in enforcement or other legal proceedings may have an adverse effect on our results of\noperations.\nWe are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in virtually every part of the world. We face risk of exposure to various types of claims,\nlawsuits and government investigations. We are involved in various claims and lawsuits related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including\nclaimed asbestos exposure), contracts, employment issues, environmental matters, intellectual property rights, tax, securities and other legal proceedings that arise in\nand outside of the ordinary course of our business. The industries in which we operate are also periodically reviewed or investigated by regulators, which could lead\nto enforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims. It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims,\ninvestigations and lawsuits, and we could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse\neffect on our reputation, business, results of operations or financial condition in any particular period.\nThe global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other\ncontingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time. In addition, subsequent developments in legal proceedings\nmay affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have an\nadverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.\n19\nTable of Contents\nNew regulations or changes in financial services regulation could adversely impact Caterpillar and Cat Financial.\nCat Financial’s operations are highly regulated by governmental authorities in the locations where it operates, which can impose significant additional costs and/or\nrestrictions on its business. In the United States, for example, certain Cat Financial activities are subject to the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act (Dodd-Frank), which includes extensive provisions regulating the financial services industry. As a result, Cat Financial has become and could\ncontinue to become subject to additional regulatory costs that could be significant and have an adverse effect on Cat Financial’s and our results of operations and\nfinancial condition. Changes in regulations or additional regulations in the United States or internationally impacting the financial services industry could also add\nsignificant cost or operational constraints that might have an adverse effect on Cat Financial’s and our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs.\nOur facilities, operations and products are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations globally, including laws and regulations governing\nemissions to noise, air, releases to soil and discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of non-hazardous and\nhazardous waste materials. Some environmental laws impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous\nsubstances, even for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred, or for the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators, predecessors or other third\nparties. Failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to penalties or clean-up costs, civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our activities,\nas well as damage to property or natural resources. The potential liabilities, sanctions, damages and remediation efforts related to any non-compliance with such\nlaws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there can be no\nassurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and\nregulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations may change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. Changes in environmental laws or regulations\ncould result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to environmental laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and\nstructure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating\nto greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. Changes in\nclimate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including\nincreased energy and raw materials costs. If environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and\ncompliance requirements upon us or our products, they could negatively impact our reputation, business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial\ncondition and competitive position",
