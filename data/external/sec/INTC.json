      "item1a":"The following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock\ncould decline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that\nwe currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable\nindicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. You should also refer to the other\ninformation set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\"\nand our financial statements and the related notes.\nChanges in product demand can harm our results of operation and financial condition.\nDemand for our products is variable and hard to predict. Changes in the demand for our products may reduce our revenue, increase our costs, lower our gross\nmargin percentage, or require us to write down the value of our assets. Important factors that could lead to variation in the demand for our products include\nchanges in:\n• business conditions, including downturns in the computing industry, or in the global or regional economies;\n• consumer confidence or income levels caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in government borrowing, taxation, or spending policies;\nthe credit market; or expected inflation, employment, and energy or other commodity prices;\n• the level of our customers’ inventories;\n• competitive and pricing pressures, including actions taken by competitors;\n• customer product needs;\n• market acceptance and industry support of our new and maturing products; and\n• the technology supply chain, including supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events.\nWe face significant competition. The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market developments, changes in\nindustry standards, changes in customer needs, and frequent product introductions and improvements. If we do not anticipate and respond to these\ndevelopments, our competitive position may weaken, and our products or technologies might be uncompetitive or obsolete. In recent years, our business focus\nhas expanded and now includes the design and production of platforms for tablets, phones, and other devices across the compute continuum, including\nproducts for the Internet of Things, and related services. As a result, we face new sources of competition, including, in certain of these market segments, from\nincumbent competitors with established customer bases and greater brand recognition. To be successful, we need to cultivate new industry relationships with\ncustomers and partners in these market segments. In addition, we must continually improve the cost, integration, and energy efficiency of our products, as well\nas expand our software capabilities to provide customers with comprehensive computing solutions. Despite our ongoing efforts, there is no guarantee that we\nwill achieve or maintain consumer and market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments.\nTo compete successfully, we must maintain a successful R&D effort, develop new products and production processes, and improve our existing products and\nprocesses ahead of competitors. For example, we invest substantially in our network of manufacturing and assembly and test facilities, including the\nconstruction of new fabrication facilities to support smaller transistor geometries and larger wafers. Our R&D efforts are critical to our success and are aimed at\nsolving complex problems, and we do not expect all of our projects to be successful. We may be unable to develop and market new products successfully, and\nthe products we invest in and develop may not be well-received by customers. Our R&D investments may not generate significant operating income or\ncontribute to our future operating results for several years, and such contributions may not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments.\nAdditionally, the products and technologies offered by others may affect demand for, or pricing of, our products.\nIf we are not able to compete effectively, our financial results will be adversely affected, including increased costs and reduced revenue and gross margin, and\nwe may be required to accelerate the write-down of the value of certain assets.\n20\nTable of Contents\nChanges in the mix of products sold may harm our financial results. Prices differ widely among the platforms we offer in our various market segments due to\ndifferences in features offered or manufacturing costs. For example, product offerings range from lower-priced and entry-level platforms, such as those based\non Intel Quark or Intel Atom processors, to higher-end platforms based on Intel Xeon and Intel Itanium processors. If demand shifts from our higher-priced to\nlower-priced platforms in any of our market segments, our gross margin and revenue would decrease. In addition, when products are introduced, they tend to\nhave higher costs because of initial development costs and lower production volumes relative to the previous product generation, which can impact gross\nmargin.\nWe operate globally and are subject to significant risks in many jurisdictions.\nGlobal or regional conditions may harm our financial results. We have manufacturing, assembly and test, R&D, sales, and other operations in many countries,\nand some of our business activities may be concentrated in one or more geographic areas. Moreover, sales outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 80%\nof our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2015. As a result, our operations and our financial results, including our ability to manufacture, assemble\nand test, design, develop, or sell products, may be adversely affected by a number of factors outside of our control, including:\n• global and local economic conditions;\n• geopolitical and security issues, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, crime, political instability, and terrorist activity;\n• natural disasters, public health issues, and other catastrophic events;\n• inefficient infrastructure and other disruptions, such as supply chain interruptions and large-scale outages or unreliable provision of services from utilities,\ntransportation, data hosting, or telecommunications providers;\n• government restrictions on, or nationalization of our operations in any country, or restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings from a particular country;\n• differing employment practices and labor issues;\n• formal or informal imposition of new or revised export and/or import and doing-business regulations, which could be changed without notice;\n• ineffective legal protection of our IP rights in certain countries; and\n• local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations worldwide, which may differ among jurisdictions, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to: IP\nownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy\nrequirements, anti-competition, advertising, employment, environment, health, and safety. Compliance with such requirements may be onerous and expensive,\nand may otherwise impact our business operations negatively. Although we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with\napplicable laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, and/or agents will not violate such laws or our policies. Violations of\nthese laws and regulations could result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and\ndamage to our reputation.\nWe may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency exchange\nrates. Although most of our sales occur in U.S. dollars, expenses may be paid in local currencies. An increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real\ncost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the U.S. where we sell in dollars, and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of expenses\nsuch as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, as well as overseas capital expenditures. We also conduct certain investing and financing activities in\nlocal currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements; therefore, changes in exchange rates\ncould harm our results of operations and financial condition.\n21\nTable of Contents\nCatastrophic events or geopolitical conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. Our operations or systems could be\ndisrupted by natural disasters; geopolitical conditions; terrorist activity; public health issues; cybersecurity incidents; interruptions of service from utilities,\ntransportation or telecommunications providers; or other catastrophic events. Such events could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver\nproducts to our customers, receive production materials from our suppliers, or perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our revenue and require\nsignificant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. While we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to enable us to recover from\nnatural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business, some of our systems are not fully redundant and we cannot be sure that our plans will\nfully protect us from all such disruptions.\nWe maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks. The types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary\ndepending on availability, cost, and decisions with respect to risk retention. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions. In addition, one\nor more of our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of\noperations and financial condition.\nWe operate our own fabrication facilities and, as a result, are vulnerable to manufacturing-related risks.\nDue to the variability in demand for our products, we may be unable to timely respond to reduce costs when demand declines or to increase production when\ndemand increases. Our operations have high costs that are either fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term, including our costs related to manufacturing, such\nas facility construction and equipment, R&D, and the employment and training of a highly skilled workforce. If product demand decreases or we fail to forecast\ndemand accurately, we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges, which would lower our gross margin. Our manufacturing or\nassembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. Factoryplanning decisions may shorten the useful lives of facilities and equipment and cause us to accelerate depreciation.\nConversely, if product demand increases, we may be unable to add capacity fast enough to meet market demand. Our revenue and gross margin can also be\naffected by the timing of our product introductions and related expenses, including marketing expenses.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing process technology. We may not be successful or efficient\nin developing or implementing new production processes. Production of integrated circuits is a complex process. We are continually engaged in the transition\nfrom our existing process to the next-generation process technology. This consistent innovation involves significant expense and carries inherent risks,\nincluding difficulties in designing and developing next-generation process technologies, development and production timing delays, lower than anticipated\nmanufacturing yields, and product defects and errata. Disruptions in the production process can also result from errors, defects in materials, delays in obtaining\nor revising operating permits and licenses, interruption in our supply of materials or resources, and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities\ndue to accidents, maintenance issues, or unsafe working conditions—all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields. Production issues can\nlead to increased costs and may affect our ability to meet product demand, which could adversely impact our business and the results from operations.\nWe face supply chain risks. Thousands of suppliers provide materials that we use in production and other aspects of our business. Where possible, we seek to\nhave several sources of supply for all of those materials. However, for certain materials, we may rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, or upon\nsuppliers in a single location. In addition, consolidation among suppliers could impact the nature, quality, availability, and pricing of the products and services\navailable to us. The inability of suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt our production processes or make it\nmore difficult for us to implement our business strategy. Production could be disrupted by the unavailability of resources used in production, such as water,\nsilicon, electricity, gases, and other materials. The unavailability or reduced availability of materials or resources may require us to reduce production or incur\nadditional costs, which could harm our business and results of operations.\n22\nTable of Contents\nWe also rely on third-party providers to manufacture and assemble and test certain components or products, particularly those related to networking, mobile\nand communications, and NAND flash memory. If any of these third parties are unable to perform these services on a timely basis, we may encounter supply\ndelays or disruptions that could adversely affect our financial results.\nIn addition, there are regulatory and other requirements, restrictions, and requests from various constituencies regarding sourcing practices and supplier\nconduct, with a trend toward expanding the scope of materials and locations where materials originate, regulating supplier behaviors, and increasing the\nrequired disclosures regarding such matters by public companies. Increased regulation and public pressure in this area would cause our compliance costs to\nincrease and could negatively affect our reputation given that we use many materials in the manufacturing of our products and rely on many suppliers to\nprovide these materials, but do not directly control their procurement or employment practices.\nWe are subject to the risks of product defects and errata. Product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications) may result from problems in our\nproduct design or our manufacturing and assembly and test processes. Components and products we purchase or license from third-party suppliers may also\ncontain defects.\nCosts from defects and errata could include:\n• writing off some or all of the value of inventory;\n• recalling products that have been shipped;\n• providing product replacements or modifications; and\n• defending against resulting litigation.\nThese costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin, and result in delay or loss of revenue. Any product defects, errata, or other\nissues that we do not detect or fix could also damage our reputation, negatively affect product demand, delay product releases, or result in legal liability. The\nannouncement of product defects and errata could cause customers to purchase products from competitors as a result of possible shortages of our\ncomponents or for other reasons. Any of these occurrences could harm our business and financial results.\nWe are subject to risks associated with environmental laws and regulations. The manufacturing and assembly and test of our products require the use of\nhazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of EHS laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in:\n• regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities;\n• suspension of production;\n• alteration of our fabrication and assembly and test processes;\n• reputational challenges; and\n• restrictions on our operations or sales.\nOur failure to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, or disposal of hazardous materials could lead to increased costs or\nfuture liabilities. Our ability to expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future may be impeded by environmental regulations, such as air quality and\nwastewater requirements. Environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product\ndesigns, or incur other expenses. Many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may be subject to regulation under environmental laws\nand regulations. These restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and\nassembly and test processes.\nClimate change may also pose regulatory and environmental risks that could harm our results of operations and affect the way we conduct business. For\nexample, climate change regulation could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution control requirements, and increased or new\nmonitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. We also see the potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations\nif, for example, utility companies pass on their costs to their customers. Furthermore, many of our operations are located in semi-arid regions that may become\nincreasingly vulnerable to prolonged droughts due to climate change. Our fabrication facilities require significant water use and, while we recycle and reuse a\nportion of the water used, we may have difficulties obtaining sufficient water to fulfill our operational needs due the lack of available infrastructure.\n23\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to IP risks and risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings.\nWe may be unable to enforce or protect our IP rights. We regard our patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and other IP rights as important to the success of our\nbusiness. We rely on IP law as well as confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers, employees, technology development partners, and others\nto protect our IP rights. Our ability to enforce these rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our IP rights in\nvarious countries. When we seek to enforce our rights, we may be subject to claims that the IP rights are invalid, not enforceable, or licensed to the opposing\nparty. Our assertion of IP rights may result in the other party seeking to assert claims against us, which could harm our business. Governments may adopt\nregulations—and governments or courts may render decisions—requiring compulsory licensing of IP rights, or governments may require products to meet\nstandards that serve to favor local companies. Our inability to enforce our IP rights under any of these circumstances may harm our competitive position and\nbusiness. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive\nposition and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in R&D, product development, and marketing could be reduced.\nOur licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives may allow competitors to use our patent rights. Companies in our industry often\nbilaterally license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements. Our competitors may have licenses to our patents, and\nunder current case law, some of the licenses may exhaust our patent rights as to licensed product sales under some circumstances. Our participation in\nindustry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives may require us to license our patents to companies that adopt industry-standard specifications.\nDepending on the rules of the organization, we might have to grant these licenses to our patents for little or no cost, and as a result, we may be unable to\nenforce certain patents against others, our costs of enforcing our licenses or protecting our patents may increase, and the value of our IP rights may be\nimpaired.\nThird parties may assert claims based on IP rights against us or our products, which could harm our business. We may face claims based on IP rights from\nindividuals and companies, including those who have acquired patent portfolios to assert claims against other companies. We are normally engaged in a\nnumber of litigation matters involving IP rights. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, whether or not meritorious, could cause us\nto incur large costs to respond to, defend, and resolve, and they may divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel. In addition, we\nmay face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets and other confidential business information or end-user data\nthat we obtain in conducting our business. Any such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business, and we could suffer losses, including the cost of\nproduct recalls and returns, and reputational harm. Furthermore, we have agreed to indemnify customers for certain IP rights claims against them. As a result of\nIP rights claims, we could:\n• pay monetary damages, including payments to satisfy indemnification obligations;\n• stop manufacturing, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products or technology subject to claims;\n• develop other products or technology not subject to claims, which could be time-consuming or costly; and/or\n• enter into settlement and license agreements, which agreements may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nThese IP rights claims could harm our competitive position, result in expenses, or require us to impair our assets. If we alter or stop production of affected\nitems, our revenue could be harmed.\nWe rely on access to third-party IP, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Many of our products include third-party IP\nand/or implement industry standards, which may require licenses from third parties. Based on past experience and industry practice, we believe such licenses\ngenerally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there is no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms\nor at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party IP, or to use such IP on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude us from selling certain products or\notherwise have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.\n24\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to the risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings. We may face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder,\nconsumer, competition, and other issues on a global basis. As described in \"Note 25: Contingencies\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we are engaged in a\nnumber of litigation and regulatory matters. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary\ndamages, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such\nas compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position,\nand overall trends. In addition, regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations, and distracting to management.\nWe must attract, retain, and motivate key employees.\nTo be competitive, we must attract, retain, and motivate executives and other key employees. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, scientists, engineers,\ntechnical staff, and sales representatives are critical to our business, and competition for experienced employees can be intense. To help attract, retain, and\nmotivate qualified employees, we use share-based and other performance-based incentive awards such as restricted stock units (RSUs) and cash bonuses. If\nour share-based or other compensation programs cease to be viewed as competitive and valuable benefits, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate\nemployees could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations.\nWe are subject to cybersecurity and privacy risks.\nThird parties attempt to gain unauthorized access to our network, products, services, and infrastructure. We regularly face attempts by others to gain\nunauthorized access through the Internet or to introduce malicious software to our information technology (IT) systems. Additionally, malicious hackers may\nattempt to gain unauthorized access and corrupt the processes of hardware and software products that we manufacture and services we provide. Due to the\nwidespread use of our products and the high profile of our commercial security products, we or our products and services are a frequent target of computer\nhackers and organizations that intend to sabotage, take control of, or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other processes, products, and services. We are\nalso a target of malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our customers or end users; steal proprietary\ninformation related to our business, products, employees, and customers; or interrupt our systems and services or those of our customers or others. We believe\nsuch attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication. From time to time, we encounter intrusions or unauthorized access to our network,\nproducts, services, or infrastructure. To date, none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business or operations. In some instances, we, our\ncustomers, and the users of our products and services might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. While we seek to detect and investigate all\nunauthorized attempts and attacks against our network, products, and services, and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes to our\ninternal processes and tools and/or changes or patches to our products and services, we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats.\nSuch incidents, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in our incurring significant costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems, reduced\ninventory value, providing modifications to our products and services, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying\ndamages, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties. In addition, these threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of\nsuccessfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures. Publicity about vulnerabilities and attempted or successful incursions\ncould damage our reputation with customers or users, and reduce demand for our products and services.\nWe may be subject to theft, loss, or misuse of personal data about our employees, customers, or other third parties, which could increase our expenses,\ndamage our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to\nrun our business could result in significantly increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Global privacy legislation, enforcement, and\npolicy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment. Costs to comply with and implement these privacyrelated and data protection measures could be significant. In addition, even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related\nor data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others.\n25\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to risks associated with transactions.\nWe invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments. We make investments in public and private companies around\nthe world to further our strategic objectives and support key business initiatives. Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable at the time of\nour initial investment. Companies in which we invest range from early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction to mature companies with\nestablished revenue streams and business models. The success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on the availability to the company of\nadditional funding on favorable terms, or a liquidity event, such as a public offering or acquisition. If any of the companies in which we invest fail, we could lose\nall or part of our investment. If we determine that an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value exists for an investment, we write down the investment to its\nfair value and recognize a loss.\nOur acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions could fail to achieve strategic objectives, disrupt our ongoing business, and harm our results of operations.\nIn pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate opportunities, and enter into agreements for possible acquisitions, divestitures,\nand other transactions, such as joint ventures. Given that our resources are limited, our decision to complete an acquisition has opportunity costs and we may\nneed to forgo the prospect of acquiring other companies or technologies that could help us achieve our strategic objectives. In addition to opportunity costs,\nthese transactions involve large challenges and risks, including risks that:\n• the transaction may not advance our business strategy;\n• we may be unable to identify opportunities on terms acceptable to us;\n• we may not realize a satisfactory return;\n• we may experience disruption of our ongoing operations;\n• we may be unable to retain key personnel;\n• we may experience difficulty in integrating new employees, business systems, and technology;\n• acquired businesses may not have adequate controls, processes, and procedures to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, and our due diligence\nprocess may not identify compliance issues or other liabilities;\n• we may have difficulty entering new market segments;\n• we may be unable to retain the customers and partners of acquired businesses; and/or\n• there may be unknown, underestimated, and/or undisclosed commitments or liabilities.\nWhen we decide to sell assets or a business, we may have difficulty selling on acceptable terms in a timely manner, and the agreed-upon terms and financing\narrangements could be renegotiated due to changes in business or market conditions. These circumstances could delay the achievement of our strategic\nobjectives or cause us to incur additional expense, or we may sell a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated, resulting in\na loss on the transaction.\nIf we do enter into agreements with respect to acquisitions, divestitures, or other transactions, we may fail to complete them due to factors such as:\n• failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals;\n• IP disputes or other litigation; or\n• difficulties obtaining financing for the transaction.\nWe are subject to sales-related risks.\nWe face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties. We sell a significant portion of our products through third parties such as distributors,\nvalue-added resellers, OEMs, ODMs, Internet service providers, and channel partners (collectively referred to as distributors). Using third parties for distribution\nexposes us to many risks, including competitive pressure, concentration, credit risk, and compliance risks. Distributors may sell products that compete with our\nproducts, and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to focus distributors on the sale of our products. We may rely on one or more key\ndistributors for a product, and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue. Distributors may face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which\ncould harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws by distributors or other\nthird-party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business. Failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales, increase\nexpenses, and weaken our competitive position.\n26\nTable of Contents\nWe face risks related to business transactions with U.S. government entities. We receive proceeds from services and products we provide to the U.S.\ngovernment. U.S. government demand and payment may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations. U.S. government contracts\nare subject to oversight, including special rules on accounting, IP rights, expenses, reviews, information handling, and security. Failure to comply with these\nrules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions, including termination of contracts, fines, and suspensions, or debarment from future U.S.\ngovernment business.\nOur results of operations could vary as a result of the methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying accounting policies.\nThe methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying accounting policies have a large impact on our results of operations. For more information, see\n\"Critical Accounting Estimates\" in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. These methods, estimates, and judgments are subject to large risks, uncertainties, and\nassumptions, and changes could affect our results of operations.\nChanges in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income.\nA number of factors may increase our effective tax rates, which could reduce our net income, including:\n• the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;\n• the resolution of issues arising from tax audits;\n• changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances;\n• adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns;\n• increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill;\n• changes in available tax credits;\n• changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including changes in the U.S. to the taxation of manufacturing enterprises and of non-U.S. income and\nexpenses;\n• changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and\n• our decision to repatriate non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes.\nWe may have fluctuations in the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases.\nThe amount, timing, and execution of our stock repurchase program may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes—such as\ninvesting in our business, including operational spending, capital spending, and acquisitions, and returning cash to our stockholders as dividend payments—\nand because of changes in cash flows and changes in tax laws.\nWorkforce restructuring actions may be disruptive to our operations and adversely affect our financial results.\nIn response to the business environment and to accomplish our strategic objectives, from time to time we may restructure our operations or make other\nadjustments to our workforce. Such workforce changes can result in restructuring charges in addition to those described in \"Note 13: Restructuring and Asset\nImpairment Charges\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Such workforce changes can also temporarily reduce workforce productivity, which could be disruptive\nto our business and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we may not achieve or sustain the expected cost savings or other benefits of our\nrestructuring plans, or do so within the expected time frame.\nThere are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls.\nWe do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no\nmatter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a\ncontrol system must reflect the fact that resource constraints exist, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of\nthe inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or\nthat all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the\nlikelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.\nProjections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate due to changes\nin conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. If our controls become inadequate, we could fail to meet our financial\nreporting obligations, our reputation may be adversely affected, our business and operating results could be harmed, and the market price of our stock could\ndecline.",

These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that\nwe currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable\nindicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Refer also to the other information set\nforth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and our financial\nstatements and the related notes.\nChanges in product demand can adversely affect our financial results.\nDemand for our products is variable and hard to predict. Changes in the demand for our products may reduce our revenue, increase our costs, lower our gross\nmargin percentage, or require us to write down the value of our assets. Our platform products are used across different market segments, and demand for our\nplatforms may vary within or among our client computing, data center, Internet of Things, and other market segments. It is difficult to anticipate the impact of\nthese changes, as demand may increase in one or more market segments while decreasing in others. Important factors that could lead to variation in the\ndemand for our products include changes in:\n• business conditions, including downturns in the computing industry, or in the global or regional economies;\n• consumer confidence or income levels caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in government borrowing, taxation, or spending policies;\nthe credit market; or expected inflation, employment, and energy or other commodity prices;\n• the level of our customers’ inventories;\n• competitive and pricing pressures, including actions taken by competitors;\n• customer product needs;\n• market acceptance and industry support of our new and maturing products; and\n• the technology supply chain, including supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events.\nWe face significant competition. The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market developments, changes in\nindustry standards, changes in customer needs, and frequent product introductions and improvements. If we do not anticipate and respond to these\ndevelopments, our competitive position may weaken, and our products or technologies might be uncompetitive or obsolete. Additionally, a number of business\ncombinations, including mergers, asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships, in the semiconductor industry have occurred over the last several years, and\nmore could occur in the future. Consolidation in the industry could lead to fewer customers, partners or suppliers, any of which could negatively affect our\nfinancial results.\nIn recent years, our business focus has expanded and now includes the design and production of platforms and other products for the data center, Internet of\nThings, and memory market segments, including FPGA products, connectivity products, and a number of other products and services for a wide range of\nconnected devices. As a result, we face new sources of competition, including, in certain of these market segments, from incumbent competitors with\nestablished customer bases and greater brand recognition. To be successful, we need to cultivate new industry relationships with customers and partners in\nthese market segments. In addition, we must continually improve the cost, integration, and energy efficiency of our products, as well as expand our software\ncapabilities to provide customers with comprehensive computing solutions. Despite our ongoing efforts, there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain\nconsumer and market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments.\n15\nTable of Contents\nTo compete successfully, we must maintain a successful R&D effort, develop new products and production processes, and improve our existing products and\nprocesses ahead of competitors. For example, we invest substantially in our network of manufacturing and assembly and test facilities, including the\nconstruction of new fabrication facilities to support smaller transistor geometries and larger wafers. Our R&D efforts are critical to our success and are aimed at\nsolving complex problems, and we do not expect all of our projects to be successful. We may be unable to develop and market new products successfully, and\nthe products we invest in and develop may not be well-received by customers. Our R&D investments may not generate significant operating income or\ncontribute to our future operating results for several years, and such contributions may not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments.\nAdditionally, the products and technologies offered by others may affect demand for, or pricing of, our products.\nIf we are not able to compete effectively, our financial results will be adversely affected, including increased costs and reduced revenue and gross margin, and\nwe may be required to accelerate the write-down of the value of certain assets.\nChanges in the mix of products sold may harm our financial results. Our pricing and margins vary across our products and market segments due to differences\nin product features or manufacturing costs. For example, our platform product offerings range from lower-priced and entry-level platforms, such as those based\non Intel Quark or Intel Atom processors, to higher-end platforms based on Intel Xeon processors. If demand shifts from our higher-priced to lower-priced\nplatforms in any of our market segments, our gross margin and revenue would decrease. In addition, when products are introduced, they tend to have higher\ncosts because of initial development costs and lower production volumes relative to the previous product generation, which can impact gross margin.\nWe operate globally and are subject to significant risks in many jurisdictions.\nGlobal or regional conditions may harm our financial results. We have manufacturing, assembly and test, R&D, sales, and other operations in many countries,\nand some of our business activities may be concentrated in one or more geographic areas. Moreover, sales outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 78%\nof our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. As a result, our operations and our financial results, including our ability to manufacture, assemble\nand test, design, develop, or sell products, may be adversely affected by a number of factors outside of our control, including:\n• global and local economic conditions;\n• geopolitical and security issues, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, crime, political instability, human rights concerns, and terrorist activity;\n• natural disasters, public health issues, and other catastrophic events;\n• inefficient infrastructure and other disruptions, such as supply chain interruptions and large-scale outages or unreliable provision of services from utilities,\ntransportation, data hosting, or telecommunications providers;\n• government restrictions on, or nationalization of our operations in any country, or restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings from a particular country;\n• differing employment practices and labor issues;\n• formal or informal imposition of new or revised export and/or import and doing-business regulations, including trade sanctions and tariffs, which could be\nchanged without notice;\n• ineffective legal protection of our IP rights in certain countries;\n• local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices; and\n• increased uncertainty regarding social, political, immigration and trade policies in the U.S. and abroad, such as recent U.S. legislation and policies and the\nUnited Kingdom's referendum to withdraw from the European Union (\"Brexit\").\nWe are subject to laws and regulations worldwide, which may differ among jurisdictions, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to: IP\nownership and infringement; tax; import and export requirements; anti-corruption; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy\nrequirements; anti-competition; advertising; employment; product regulations; environment, health, and safety requirements; and consumer laws. Compliance\nwith such requirements may be onerous and expensive, and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively. Although we have policies, controls,\nand procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, and/or agents\nwill not violate such laws or our policies. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our\nemployees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation.\n16\nTable of Contents\nWe may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency exchange\nrates. Although most of our sales occur in U.S. dollars, expenses may be paid in local currencies. An increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real\ncost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the U.S. where we sell in dollars, and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of expenses\nsuch as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, as well as overseas capital expenditures. We also conduct certain investing and financing activities in\nlocal currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements; therefore, changes in exchange rates\ncould harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nCatastrophic events or geopolitical conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. Our operations or systems could be\ndisrupted by natural disasters; industrial accidents; geopolitical conditions; terrorist activity; public health issues; cybersecurity incidents; interruptions of service\nfrom utilities, transportation, or telecommunications providers; or other catastrophic events. Such events could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or\ndeliver products to our customers, receive production materials from our suppliers, or perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our revenue and\nrequire significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. While we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to enable us to recover\nfrom natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business, some of our systems are not fully redundant and we cannot be sure that our plans\nwill fully protect us from all such disruptions.\nWe maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks. The types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary\ndepending on availability, cost, and decisions with respect to risk retention. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions. In addition, one\nor more of our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of\noperations and financial condition.\nWe are vulnerable to product and manufacturing-related risks.\nDue to the variability in demand for our products and the complexity of our manufacturing operations, we may be unable to timely respond to fluctuations in\ndemand. Our operations have high costs that are either fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term, including our costs related to manufacturing, such as facility\nconstruction and equipment, R&D, and the employment and training of a highly skilled workforce. If product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand\naccurately, we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges, which would lower our gross margin. Our manufacturing or assembly\nand test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. Factory-planning\ndecisions may shorten the useful lives of facilities and equipment and cause us to accelerate depreciation.\nConversely, if product demand increases, we may be unable to add capacity fast enough to meet market demand. Our revenue and gross margin can also be\naffected by the timing of our product introductions and related expenses, including marketing expenses.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing process technology. We may not be successful or efficient\nin developing or implementing new production processes. Production of integrated circuits is a complex process. We are continually engaged in the transition\nfrom our existing process to the next-generation process technology. This consistent innovation involves significant expense and carries inherent risks,\nincluding difficulties in designing and developing next-generation process technologies, development and production timing delays, lower than anticipated\nmanufacturing yields, and product defects and errata. Disruptions in the production process can also result from errors, defects in materials, delays in obtaining\nor revising operating permits and licenses, interruption in our supply of materials or resources, and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities\ndue to accidents, maintenance issues, or unsafe working conditions—all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields. Production issues can\nlead to increased costs and may affect our ability to meet product demand, which could adversely impact our business and the results from operations.\n17\nTable of Contents\nWe face supply chain risks. Thousands of suppliers provide materials and equipment that we use in production and other aspects of our business. Where\npossible, we seek to have several sources of supply for all of those materials. However, for certain materials, we may rely on a single or a limited number of\nsuppliers, or upon suppliers in a single location. In addition, consolidation among suppliers could impact the nature, quality, availability, and pricing of the\nproducts and services available to us. The inability of suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt our\nproduction processes or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy. Production could be disrupted by the unavailability of resources used\nin production, such as water, silicon, electricity, gases, and other materials. The unavailability or reduced availability of materials or resources may require us to\nreduce production or incur additional costs, which could harm our business and results of operations. Our manufacturing operations and ability to meet product\ndemand may also be impacted by IP or other litigation between our suppliers, where an injunction against Intel or a supplier could interrupt the availability of\ngoods or services supplied to Intel by others.\nWe also rely on third-party providers to manufacture and assemble and test certain components or products, particularly those related to networking, mobile\nand communications, programmable semiconductor solutions, and NAND flash memory. If any of these third parties are unable to perform these services on a\ntimely or cost-effective basis, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions that could adversely affect our financial results.\nIn addition, there are regulatory and other requirements, restrictions, and requests from various constituencies regarding sourcing practices and supplier\nconduct, with a trend toward expanding the scope of materials and locations where materials originate, regulating supplier behaviors, and increasing the\nrequired disclosures regarding such matters by public companies. Increased regulation and public pressure in this area would cause our compliance costs to\nincrease and could negatively affect our reputation given that we use many materials in the manufacturing of our products and rely on many suppliers to\nprovide these materials, but do not directly control their procurement or employment practices.\nWe are subject to the risks of product defects, errata or other product issues. Product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications) may result\nfrom problems in our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test processes. Components and products we purchase or license from third-party\nsuppliers, or attain through acquisitions, may also contain defects. We could face risks if products that we design, manufacture or sell, or that include our\ntechnology, cause personal injury or property damage, even where the cause is unrelated to product defects or errata. These risks may increase as our\nproducts are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies, or applications through the Internet of Things, including wearables, drones and transportation,\nand industrial and consumer uses. Costs from defects, errata, or other product issues could include:\n• writing off some or all of the value of inventory;\n• recalling products that have been shipped;\n• providing product replacements or modifications;\n• reimbursing customers for certain costs they incur;\n• defending against litigation and/or paying resulting damages; and\n• paying fines imposed by regulatory agencies.\nThese costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin, and result in delay or loss of revenue. Any product defects, errata, or other\nissues could also damage our reputation, negatively affect product demand, delay product releases, or result in legal liability. The announcement of product\ndefects or errata could cause customers to purchase products from competitors as a result of possible shortages of our components or for other reasons. Any\nof these occurrences could harm our business and financial results. In addition, although we maintain liability insurance, our coverage has certain exclusions\nand/or may not adequately cover liabilities incurred. Our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim, and losses not covered by insurance\ncould be large, which could harm our financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks associated with environmental laws and regulations. The manufacturing and assembly and test of our products require the use of\nhazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws or\nregulations could result in:\n• regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities;\n• suspension of production;\n• alteration of our manufacturing and assembly and test processes;\n• reputational challenges; and\n• restrictions on our operations or sales.\n18\nTable of Contents\nOur failure to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, or disposal of hazardous materials could lead to increased costs or\nfuture liabilities. Our ability to expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future may be impeded by environmental regulations, such as air quality and\nwastewater requirements. Environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product\ndesigns, or incur other expenses. Many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may be subject to regulation under environmental laws\nand regulations. These restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and\nassembly and test processes.\nClimate change may also pose regulatory and environmental risks that could harm our results of operations and affect the way we conduct business. For\nexample, climate change regulation could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution control requirements, and increased or new\nmonitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. We also see the potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations\nif, for example, utility companies pass on their costs to their customers. Furthermore, many of our operations are located in semi-arid regions that may become\nincreasingly vulnerable to prolonged droughts due to climate change. Our fabrication facilities require significant water use and, while we recycle and reuse a\nportion of the water used, we may have difficulties obtaining sufficient water to fulfill our operational needs due the lack of available infrastructure.\nWe are subject to IP risks and risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings.\nWe may be unable to enforce or protect our IP rights. We regard our patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and other IP rights as important to the success of our\nbusiness. We rely on IP law as well as confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers, employees, technology development partners, and others\nto protect our IP rights. Our ability to enforce these rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our IP rights in\nvarious countries. When we seek to enforce our rights, we may be subject to claims that the IP rights are invalid, not enforceable, or licensed to the opposing\nparty. Our assertion of IP rights may result in the other party seeking to assert claims against us, which could harm our business. Governments may adopt\nregulations—and governments or courts may render decisions—requiring compulsory licensing of IP rights, or governments may require products to meet\nstandards that serve to favor local companies. Our inability to enforce our IP rights under any of these circumstances may harm our competitive position and\nbusiness. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive\nposition and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in R&D, product development, and marketing could be reduced.\nOur licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives may allow competitors to use our patent rights. Companies in our industry often\nbilaterally license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements. Our competitors may have licenses to our patents, and\nunder current case law, some of the licenses may exhaust our patent rights as to licensed product sales under some circumstances. Our participation in\nindustry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives may require us to license our patents to companies that adopt industry-standard specifications.\nDepending on the rules of the organization, we might have to grant these licenses to our patents for little or no cost, and as a result, we may be unable to\nenforce certain patents against others, our costs of enforcing our licenses or protecting our patents may increase, and the value of our IP rights may be\nimpaired.\n19\nTable of Contents\nThird parties may assert claims based on IP rights against us or our products, which could harm our business. We may face claims based on IP rights from\nindividuals and companies, including those who have acquired patent portfolios to assert claims against other companies. We are normally engaged in a\nnumber of litigation matters involving IP rights. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, whether or not meritorious, could cause us\nto incur large costs to respond to, defend, and resolve, and they may divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel. In addition, we\nmay face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets and other confidential business information or end-user data\nthat we obtain in conducting our business. Any such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business, and we could suffer losses, including the cost of\nproduct recalls and returns, and reputational harm. Furthermore, we have agreed to indemnify customers for certain IP rights claims against them. As a result of\nIP rights claims, we could:\n• pay monetary damages, including payments to satisfy indemnification obligations;\n• stop manufacturing, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products or technology subject to claims;\n• develop other products or technology not subject to claims, which could be time-consuming or costly; and/or\n• enter into settlement and license agreements, which agreements may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nThese IP rights claims could harm our competitive position, result in expenses, or require us to impair our assets. If we alter or stop production of affected\nitems, our revenue could be harmed.\nWe rely on access to third-party IP, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Many of our products include third-party IP\nand/or implement industry standards, which may require licenses from third parties. Based on past experience and industry practice, we believe such licenses\ngenerally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there is no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms\nor at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party IP, or to use such IP on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude us from selling certain products or\notherwise have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nWe are subject to the risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings. We may face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder,\nconsumer, competition, and other issues on a global basis. As described in \"Note 20: Commitments and Contingencies\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we\nare engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur,\nincluding monetary damages, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring\nother remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of\noperations, financial position, and overall trends. In addition, regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations,\nand distracting to management.\nWe must attract, retain, and motivate key employees.\nTo be competitive, we must attract, retain, and motivate executives and other key employees. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, scientists, engineers,\ntechnical staff, and sales representatives are critical to our business, and competition for experienced employees can be intense. To help attract, retain, and\nmotivate qualified employees, we use share-based and other performance-based incentive awards such as restricted stock units (RSUs) and cash bonuses.\nAlso key to our employee hiring and retention is our ability to build and maintain an inclusive business culture and be viewed as an employer of choice. If our\nshare-based or other compensation programs and workplace culture cease to be viewed as competitive, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees\ncould be weakened, which could harm our results of operations.\n20\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to cybersecurity and privacy risks.\nThird parties attempt to gain unauthorized access to our network, products, services, and infrastructure. We regularly face attempts by others to gain\nunauthorized access through the Internet or to introduce malicious software to our information technology (IT) systems. Additionally, malicious hackers may\nattempt to gain unauthorized access and corrupt the processes of hardware and software products that we manufacture and services we provide. Due to the\nwidespread use of our products and the high profile of our commercial security products, we or our products and services are a frequent target of computer\nhackers and organizations that intend to sabotage, take control of, or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other processes, products, and services. We are\nalso a target of malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our customers or end users; steal proprietary\ninformation related to our business, products, employees, and customers; or interrupt our systems and services or those of our customers or others. We believe\nsuch attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication. From time to time, we encounter intrusions or unauthorized access to our network,\nproducts, services, or infrastructure. To date, none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business or operations. In some instances, we, our\ncustomers, and the users of our products and services might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. While we seek to detect and investigate all\nunauthorized attempts and attacks against our network, products, and services, and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes to our\ninternal processes and tools and/or changes or patches to our products and services, we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats.\nSuch incidents, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in our incurring significant costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems, reduced\ninventory value, providing modifications to our products and services, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying\ndamages, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties. In addition, these threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of\nsuccessfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures. Publicity about vulnerabilities and attempted or successful incursions\ncould damage our reputation with customers or users, and reduce demand for our products and services.\nWe may be subject to theft, loss, or misuse of personal data about our employees, customers, or other third parties, which could increase our expenses,\ndamage our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to\nrun our business could result in significantly increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Global privacy legislation, enforcement, and\npolicy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment. Costs to comply with and implement these privacyrelated and data protection measures could be significant. In addition, even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related\nor data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others.\nWe are subject to risks associated with transactions.\nWe invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments. We make investments in public and private companies around\nthe world to further our strategic objectives and support key business initiatives. Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable at the time of\nour initial investment. Companies in which we invest range from early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction to mature companies with\nestablished revenue streams and business models. The success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on the availability to the company of\nadditional funding on favorable terms, or a liquidity event, such as a public offering or acquisition. If any of the companies in which we invest fail, we could lose\nall or part of our investment.\n21\nTable of Contents\nOur acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions could fail to achieve strategic objectives, disrupt our ongoing business, and harm our results of operations.\nIn pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate opportunities, and enter into agreements for possible acquisitions, divestitures,\nand other transactions, such as joint ventures. Given that our resources are limited, our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly, if\nwe pursue a particular transaction, we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives. In\naddition to opportunity costs, these transactions involve large challenges and risks, including risks that:\n• the transaction may not advance our business strategy;\n• we may be unable to identify opportunities on terms acceptable to us;\n• we may not realize a satisfactory return;\n• we may experience disruption of our ongoing operations;\n• we may be unable to retain key personnel;\n• we may experience difficulty in integrating new employees, business systems, and technology;\n• acquired businesses may not have adequate controls, processes, and procedures to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, and our due diligence\nprocess may not identify compliance issues or other liabilities;\n• we may have difficulty entering new market segments;\n• we may be unable to retain the customers and partners of acquired businesses; and/or\n• there may be unknown, underestimated, and/or undisclosed commitments or liabilities.\nWhen we decide to sell assets or a business, we may have difficulty selling on acceptable terms in a timely manner, and the agreed-upon terms and financing\narrangements could be renegotiated due to changes in business or market conditions. These circumstances could delay the achievement of our strategic\nobjectives or cause us to incur additional expense, or we may sell a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated, resulting in\na loss on the transaction.\nIf we do enter into agreements with respect to acquisitions, divestitures, or other transactions, we may fail to complete them due to factors such as:\n• failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals;\n• IP disputes or other litigation; or\n• difficulties obtaining financing for the transaction.\nWe are subject to sales-related risks.\nWe face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties. We sell a significant portion of our products through third parties such as distributors,\nvalue-added resellers, and channel partners (collectively referred to as distributors) as well as OEMs, ODMs and Internet service providers. We depend on\nmany distributors to help us create end customer demand, provide technical support and other value-added services to customers, fill customer orders, and\nstock our products. We may rely on one or more key distributors for a product, and a material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors\nor their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue. Our ability to add or replace distributors for some of our products may be limited. In addition,\nour distributors' expertise in the determination and stocking of acceptable inventory levels for some of our products may not be easily transferable to a new\ndistributor; as a result, end customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a distributor. Using third parties for distribution exposes us to\nmany risks, including competitive pressure, concentration, credit risk, and compliance risks. Distributors and other third parties may sell products that compete\nwith our products, and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to focus them on the sale of our products. They may face financial difficulties,\nincluding bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws\nby distributors or other third-party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business. Failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors and\nother third parties may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position.\n22\nTable of Contents\nWe face risks related to business transactions with U.S. government entities. We receive proceeds from services and products we provide to the U.S.\ngovernment. U.S. government demand and payment may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations. U.S. government contracts\nare subject to oversight, including special rules on accounting, IP rights, expenses, reviews, information handling, and security. Failure to comply with these\nrules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions, including termination of contracts, fines, and suspensions, or debarment from future U.S.\ngovernment business.\nOur results of operations could vary as a result of the methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying accounting policies.\nThe methods, estimates, and judgments used in applying accounting policies are subject to significant risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and changes that\ncould affect our financial position and results of operations. For more information, see \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" in Part II, Item 7 and \"Note 2: Accounting\nPolicies\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nChanges in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income.\nA number of factors may increase our effective tax rates, which could reduce our net income, including:\n• changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed;\n• the resolution of issues arising from tax audits;\n• changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances;\n• adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns;\n• increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill;\n• changes in available tax credits;\n• changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including changes in the U.S. to the taxation of manufacturing enterprises and of non-U.S. income and\nexpenses;\n• changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and\n• our decision to repatriate non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes.\nWe may have fluctuations in the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases.\nThe amount, timing, and execution of our stock repurchase program may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes—such as\ninvesting in our business, including operational spending, capital spending, and acquisitions, and returning cash to our stockholders as dividend payments—\nand because of changes in cash flows and changes in tax laws.\nWorkforce restructuring actions may be disruptive to our operations and adversely affect our financial results.\nIn response to the business environment and to accomplish our strategic objectives, we have announced restructurings of our operations and have made other\nadjustments to our workforce. We may pursue similar actions in the future, and such workforce changes can result in restructuring charges in addition to those\ndescribed in \"Note 7: Restructuring and Other Charges\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Any such workforce changes can also temporarily reduce workforce\nproductivity, which could be disruptive to our business and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, if our restructurings are perceived negatively,\nour corporate reputation and ability to attract employees could suffer. Moreover, we may not achieve or sustain the expected cost savings or other benefits of\nour restructuring plans, or do so within the expected time frame.\nAdditional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations with regard to our restructuring activity include:\n• timing and execution of plans and programs that may be subject to local labor law requirements, including consultation with appropriate works councils;\n• assumptions related to severance, post-retirement, and relocation costs;\n• future acquisitions, dispositions, or investments;\n• new business initiatives and changes in product roadmap, development, and manufacturing; and/or\n• assumptions related to cost savings, product demand, and operating efficiencies.\n23\nTable of Contents\nThere are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls.\nWe do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no\nmatter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a\ncontrol system must reflect the fact that resource constraints exist, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of\nthe inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or\nthat all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the\nlikelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.\nProjections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate due to changes\nin conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. If our controls become inadequate, we could fail to meet our financial\nreporting obligations, our reputation may be adversely affected, our business and operating results could be harmed, and the market price of our stock could\ndecline.",

Our platform products are used across different market segments, and demand for our platforms may vary within or\namong our client computing, data center, Internet of Things, and other market segments. It is difficult to anticipate the impact of these changes, as demand may increase in one\nor more market segments while decreasing in others. Changes in the demand for our products, particularly in the client computing or data center market segments, may reduce\nour revenue, lower our gross margin, or require us to write down the value of our assets.\nImportant factors that could lead to variation in the demand for our products include changes in:\n• business conditions, including downturns in the market segments in which we operate, or in the global or regional economies;\n• consumer confidence or income levels caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in government borrowing, taxation, or spending policies; the credit\nmarket; or expected inflation, employment, and energy or other commodity prices;\n• the level of our customers’ inventories;\n• competitive and pricing pressures, including actions taken by competitors;\n• customer order patterns, including order cancellations;\n• failure to timely introduce competitive products; and\n• market acceptance and industry support of our new and maturing products.\nDue to the complexity of our manufacturing operations, we may be unable to timely respond to fluctuations in demand and we may incur significant charges and costs. Because\nwe own and operate high-tech fabrication facilities, our operations have high costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term, including our costs related to utilization of\nexisting facilities, facility construction and equipment, R&D, and the employment and training of a highly skilled workforce. If product demand decreases or we fail to forecast\ndemand accurately, we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges, which would lower our gross margin. If the demand decrease is prolonged, our\nmanufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. We may\nalso be required to shorten the useful lives of under-used facilities and equipment and accelerate depreciation. Conversely, if product demand increases, we may be unable to\nadd capacity fast enough to meet market demand.\nWe face significant competition. The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market developments, changes in industry\nstandards, changes in customer needs, and frequent product introductions and improvements. If we do not anticipate and respond to these developments, our competitive\nposition may weaken, and our products or technologies might be uncompetitive or become obsolete. Additionally, a number of business combinations—including mergers, asset\nacquisitions, and strategic partnerships—in the semiconductor industry have occurred over the last several years, and more could occur in the future. Consolidation in the\nindustry could lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any of which could negatively affect our financial results.\nIn recent years, in connection with our strategic transformation to a data-centric company, we have entered new areas and introduced adjacent products in programmable\nsolutions, AI, and autonomous driving; we have also expanded our adjacent product offerings in client computing, the data center, the Internet of Things, and memory, with\nofferings such as modems, silicon photonics solutions, and 3D XPoint technology products. As a result, we face new sources of competition, including, in certain of these market\nsegments, from incumbent competitors with established customer bases and greater brand recognition. These developing products and market segments may not grow as\nsignificantly as projected, or at all, or may utilize technologies that are different from the ones that we develop and manufacture. To be successful, we need to cultivate new\nindustry relationships with customers and partners in these market segments. In addition, we must continually improve the cost, performance, integration, and energy efficiency\nof our products, as well as expand our software capabilities to provide customers with comprehensive computing solutions. Despite our ongoing efforts, there is no guarantee\nthat we will achieve or maintain market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments.\nOTHER KEY INFORMATION 46\nTable of Contents\nTo compete successfully, we must maintain a successful R&D effort, develop new products and production processes, and improve our existing products and processes ahead of\ncompetitors. For example, we invest substantially in our network of manufacturing and assembly and test facilities, including the construction of new fabrication facilities to\nsupport smaller transistor geometries and larger wafers. We do not expect all of our R&D investments to be successful. We may be unable to develop and market new products\nsuccessfully, and the products and technologies we invest in and develop may not be well-received by customers. Our R&D investments may not contribute to our future\noperating results for several years, if at all, and such contributions may not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments. Additionally, the products and\ntechnologies offered by others may affect demand for, or pricing of, our products.\nIf we are not able to compete effectively, our financial results will be adversely affected, including reduced revenue and gross margin, and we may be required to accelerate the\nwrite-down of the value of certain assets.\nChanges in the mix of products sold may impact our financial results. Our pricing and margins vary across our products and market segments due in part to marketability of our\nproducts and differences in their features or manufacturing costs. For example, our platform product offerings range from lower-priced and entry-level platforms, such as those\nbased on Intel Atom processors, to higher-end platforms based on Intel Xeon processors. If demand shifts from our higher-priced to lower-priced products in any of our market\nsegments, our gross margin and revenue would decrease.\nWE OPERATE GLOBALLY AND ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS IN MANY JURISDICTIONS.\nGlobal or regional conditions may harm our financial results. We have manufacturing, assembly and test, R&D, sales, and other operations in many countries, and some of our\nbusiness activities may be concentrated in one or more geographic areas. Moreover, sales outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 83% of our revenue for the fiscal year\nended December 30, 2017. As a result, our operations and our financial results, including our ability to manufacture, assemble and test, design, develop, or sell products, may be\nadversely affected by a number of factors outside of our control, including:\n• global and regional economic conditions;\n• geopolitical and security issues, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, political instability (including geopolitical uncertainty on the Korean peninsula), human\nrights concerns, and terrorist activity;\n• natural disasters, public health issues, and other catastrophic events;\n• inefficient infrastructure and other disruptions, such as supply chain interruptions and large-scale outages or unreliable provision of services from utilities, transportation, data\nhosting, or telecommunications providers;\n• government restrictions on, or nationalization of our operations in any country, or restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings from a particular country;\n• differing employment practices and labor issues;\n• formal or informal imposition of new or revised export and/or import and doing-business regulations, including trade sanctions and tariffs, which could be changed without\nnotice;\n• ineffective legal protection of our IP rights in certain countries;\n• local business and cultural factors that differ from our current standards and practices; and\n• continuing uncertainty regarding social, political, immigration, and tax and trade policies in the U.S. and abroad, including the United Kingdom's vote to withdraw from the\nEuropean Union.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations worldwide, which may differ among jurisdictions, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to: IP ownership and\ninfringement; tax; import and export requirements; anti-corruption; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition;\nadvertising; employment; product regulations; environment, health, and safety requirements; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements may be onerous and\nexpensive, and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively. For example, unfavorable developments with evolving laws and regulations worldwide related to 5G\ntechnology may limit its global introduction and adoption, which could impede our modem strategy and negatively impact our long-term outlook. Although we have policies,\ncontrols, and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, and/or agents will not\nviolate such laws or our policies. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the\nconduct of our business; and damage to our reputation.\nWe may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency exchange rates. Although\nmost of our sales occur in U.S. dollars, expenses may be paid in local currencies. An increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our\nproducts in those markets outside the U.S. where we sell in dollars, and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of expenses such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing\nexpenses, as well as overseas capital expenditures. We also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not\neliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements; therefore, changes in exchange rates could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nOTHER KEY INFORMATION 47\nTable of Contents\nCatastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. Our operations and business could be disrupted by natural disasters; industrial\naccidents; public health issues; cybersecurity incidents; interruptions of service from utilities, transportation, or telecommunications providers; or other catastrophic events. Such\nevents could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver products to our customers, receive production materials from our suppliers, or perform critical functions,\nwhich could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. While we maintain business recovery plans that are\nintended to enable us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business, some of our systems are not fully redundant and we cannot be sure\nthat our plans will fully protect us from all such disruptions.\nWe maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks. The types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability,\ncost, and decisions with respect to risk retention. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions. In addition, one or more of our insurance providers may be\nunable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nWE ARE VULNERABLE TO PRODUCT AND MANUFACTURING-RELATED RISKS.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing process technology. Production of integrated circuits is a complex process.\nOur strategy is significantly dependent upon the timely advancement of Moore’s Law and we are continually engaged in the development of next-generation process\ntechnologies. We may not be successful or efficient in developing or implementing new process nodes and production processes. Our efforts to innovate involve significant\nexpense and carry inherent risks, including difficulties in designing and developing such next-generation process technologies, and investments in manufacturing assets and\nfacilities years in advance of the process node introduction.\nRisks inherent in the development of next-generation process technologies include production timing delays, lower than anticipated manufacturing yields, and product defects\nand errata. Disruptions in the production process can also result from errors, defects in materials, delays in obtaining or revising operating permits and licenses, interruption in\nour supply of materials or resources, and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents, maintenance issues, or unsafe working conditions—all of\nwhich could affect the timing of production ramps and yields. Production issues can lead to increased costs and may affect our ability to meet product demand, which could\nadversely impact our business and the results of operations. In addition, if we face unexpected delays in the timing of our product introductions, our revenue and gross margin\ncould be adversely affected because we incur significant costs up front in the product development stage and earn revenue to offset these costs over time.\nWe face supply chain risks. Thousands of suppliers provide materials and equipment that we use in production and other aspects of our business. Where possible, we seek to\nhave several sources of supply. However, for certain materials, we may rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single location. In addition,\nconsolidation among suppliers could impact the nature, quality, availability, and pricing of the products and services available to us. The inability of suppliers to deliver necessary\nproduction materials or equipment could disrupt our production processes and make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy. Production could be disrupted by\nthe unavailability of resources, such as water, silicon, electricity, gases, and other materials. The unavailability or reduced availability of materials or resources may require us to\nreduce production or incur additional costs, which could harm our business and results of operations. Our manufacturing operations and ability to meet product demand may also\nbe impacted by IP or other litigation between our suppliers, where an injunction against Intel or a supplier could interrupt the availability of goods or services supplied to Intel by\nothers.\nWe also rely on third-party providers to manufacture and assemble and test certain components or products, particularly those related to networking, communications,\nprogrammable semiconductor solutions, and NAND flash memory. If any of these third parties are unable to perform these services on a timely or cost-effective basis, we may\nencounter supply delays or disruptions that could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIn addition, increased regulation or stakeholder expectations regarding responsible sourcing practices could cause our compliance costs to increase or result in publicity that\nnegatively affects our reputation. Moreover, given that we use many materials in the manufacturing of our products and rely on many suppliers to provide these materials, but do\nnot directly control the procurement or employment practices of such suppliers, we could be subject to similar financial or reputational risks as a result of our suppliers' conduct.\nOTHER KEY INFORMATION 48\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to the risks of product defects, errata, or other product issues. Product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications) may result from problems in\nour product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test processes. Components and products we purchase or license from third-party suppliers, or attain through\nacquisitions, may also contain defects. We could face risks if products that we design, manufacture, or sell, or that include our technology, cause personal injury or property\ndamage, even where the cause is unrelated to product defects or errata. These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, market segments,\ntechnologies, or applications, including wearables, drones and transportation, health care and financial transactions, and other industrial and consumer uses. Costs from defects,\nerrata, or other product issues could include:\n• writing off some or all of the value of inventory;\n• recalling products that have been shipped;\n• providing product replacements or modifications;\n• reimbursing customers for certain costs they incur;\n• defending against litigation and/or paying resulting damages; and\n• paying fines imposed by regulatory agencies.\nThese costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin, and result in delay or loss of revenue. Any product defects, errata, or other issues could also\ndamage our reputation, negatively affect product demand, delay product releases, or result in legal liability. The announcement of product defects or errata could cause\ncustomers to purchase products from competitors. Any of these occurrences could harm our business and financial results. In addition, although we maintain liability insurance,\nour coverage has certain exclusions and/or may not adequately cover liabilities incurred. Our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim, and losses not\ncovered by insurance could be large, which could harm our financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks associated with environmental, health, and safety regulations and climate change. The manufacturing and assembly and test of our products require the\nuse of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws or regulations could\nresult in:\n• regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities;\n• suspension of production;\n• alteration of our manufacturing and assembly and test processes;\n• damage to our reputation; and\n• restrictions on our operations or sales.\nOur failure to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, or disposal of hazardous materials could lead to increased costs or future liabilities. Our\nability to expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future may be impeded by environmental regulations, such as air quality and wastewater requirements.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire additional pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product designs, or incur other expenses.\nMany new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may be subject to regulation under environmental laws and regulations. These restrictions could harm our\nbusiness and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processes.\nClimate change may also pose regulatory and environmental risks that could harm our results of operations and affect the way we conduct business. For example, climate\nchange regulation could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution control requirements, and increased or new monitoring, recordkeeping, and\nreporting of greenhouse gas emissions. We also see the potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations if, for example, utility companies pass on their\ncosts to their customers. Furthermore, many of our operations are located in semi-arid regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and Israel that may become increasingly vulnerable\nto rising average temperatures or prolonged droughts due to climate change. Our fabrication facilities require significant water use and, while we recycle and reuse a portion of\nthe water used, we may have difficulties obtaining sufficient water to fulfill our operational needs. In addition, climate change may pose physical and regulatory risks to our\nsuppliers, including increased extreme weather events that could result in supply delays or disruptions.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY RISKS.\nThird parties regularly attempt to gain unauthorized access to our network, products, services, and infrastructure. We regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized\naccess through the Internet or to introduce malicious software to our IT systems. Additionally, individuals or organizations, including malicious hackers or intruders into our\nphysical facilities, may attempt to gain unauthorized access and corrupt the processes of hardware and software products that we manufacture and services we provide. Due to\nthe widespread use of our products, we are a frequent target of computer hackers and organizations that intend to sabotage, take control of, or otherwise corrupt our\nmanufacturing or other processes, products, and services. We are also a target of malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our\ncustomers or end users; steal proprietary information related to our business, products, employees, and customers; or interrupt our systems and services or those of our\ncustomers or others. We believe such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication. As we become a more data-centric company, our processors may be\nused in more and different critical application areas and may be subject to increased cybersecurity and privacy risks.\nFrom time to time, we encounter intrusions or unauthorized access to our network, products, services, or infrastructure. To date, none have resulted in any material adverse\nimpact to our business or operations. Such incidents, whether or not successful, could result in our incurring significant costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems,\nwriting down inventory value, implementing\nOTHER KEY INFORMATION 49\nTable of Contents\nadditional threat protection measures, providing modifications to our products and services, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying\ndamages, providing customers with incentives to maintain the business relationship, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties. In addition, these threats are\nconstantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures. While we seek to detect and\ninvestigate all unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network, products, and services, and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes to our internal\nprocesses and tools and/or changes or updates to our products and services, we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats. In some instances, we,\nour customers, and the users of our products and services may be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects.\nSecurity vulnerabilities may exist with respect to our processors and other products as well as the operating systems and workloads running on them. Mitigation techniques\ndesigned to address these security vulnerabilities, including software and firmware updates or other preventative measures, may not operate as intended or effectively resolve\nthese vulnerabilities. In addition, we may be required to rely on third parties, including hardware, software, and services vendors, as well as end users, to develop and deploy\nmitigation techniques, and the effectiveness of mitigation techniques may depend solely or in part on the actions of these third parties. Security vulnerabilities and/or mitigation\ntechniques, including software and firmware updates, may result in adverse performance, reboots, system instability, data loss or corruption, unpredictable system behavior, or\nthe misappropriation of data by third parties, which could adversely impact our business and harm our reputation.\nA side-channel exploit is a type of security vulnerability that has recently received attention as a result of the variants referred to as “Spectre” and “Meltdown.” Information on\nthese variants was prematurely reported publicly before mitigation techniques to address all vulnerabilities were made widely available, and certain of the mitigation techniques\ndid not operate as intended. To date, we do not expect a material financial impact to our business or operations from these security vulnerabilities. However, subsequent events\nor new information could develop which changes our expectations, including additional information learned as we deploy updates, evaluate the competitiveness of existing and\nnew products, address future warranty or other claims or customer satisfaction considerations, as well as developments in the course of responding to any litigation or\ninvestigations over these matters. The recent publicity regarding side-channel exploits may also result in increased attempts by third parties to identify additional variants. We will\ncontinue to reassess whether or not we expect to be exposed to a loss that could be material.\nAs a result of the foregoing risks, we have and may continue to face product claims, litigation, and adverse publicity and customer relations from security vulnerabilities and/or\nmitigation techniques. Publicity about security vulnerabilities and attempted or successful exploits, whether accurate or inaccurate, may result in increased attempts by third\nparties to identify additional vulnerabilities. This publicity could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce demand for our products and services. In addition,\nfuture vulnerabilities and mitigation of those vulnerabilities may also adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition, customer relationships, and reputation.\nMoreover, we may be unable to anticipate the timing of the release of information by third parties regarding potential vulnerabilities of our products, which, in turn, has and could\nadversely impact our ability to timely introduce mitigation techniques and thereby harm our business and reputation.\nWe may be subject to theft, loss, or misuse of personal data about our employees, customers, or other third parties, which could increase our expenses, damage our reputation,\nor result in legal or regulatory proceedings. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly\nincreased business and security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and\ncreating a complex regulatory compliance environment. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant. In addition,\neven our inadvertent failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by\ngovernmental entities or others.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO IP RISKS AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS.\nWe may be unable to enforce or protect our IP rights. We regard our patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and other IP rights as important to the success of our business. We rely\non IP law—as well as confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers, employees, technology development partners, and others—to protect our IP rights. Our ability\nto enforce these rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our IP rights in various countries. When we seek to enforce our rights,\nwe may be subject to claims that our IP rights are invalid, not enforceable, or licensed to an opposing party. Our assertion of IP rights may result in another party seeking to\nassert claims against us, which could harm our business. Governments may adopt regulations—and governments or courts may render decisions—requiring compulsory\nlicensing of IP rights, or governments may require products to meet standards that favor local companies. Our inability to enforce our IP rights under any of these circumstances\nmay harm our competitive position and business. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could\nharm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in R&D, product development, and marketing could be reduced.\nOur licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives may allow competitors to use our patent rights. Technology companies often bilaterally license patents\nbetween each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements. Our competitors may have licenses to our patents, and under current case law, some of the licenses\nmay exhaust our patent rights as to licensed product sales under some circumstances. Our participation in industry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives may\nrequire us to license our patents to companies that adopt industry-standard specifications. Depending on the rules of the organization, government regulations, or court\ndecisions, we might have to grant licenses to our patents for little or no cost, and as a result, we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others, our costs of enforcing\nour licenses or protecting our patents may increase, and the value of our IP rights may be impaired.\nOTHER KEY INFORMATION 50\nTable of Contents\nThird parties may assert claims based on IP rights against us or our products, which could harm our business. We may face claims based on IP rights from individuals and\ncompanies, including claims from those who have aggregated patents acquired from multiple sources to form a new, larger portfolio to assert claims against us and other\ncompanies. Additionally, large patent portfolio owners may divest portions of their portfolios to more than one individual or company increasing the number of parties who own IP\nrights previously all held by a single party. We are typically engaged in a number of disputes involving IP rights. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of\nothers, regardless of their merits, could cause us to incur large costs to respond to, defend, and resolve the claims, and they may divert the efforts and attention of our\nmanagement and technical personnel from our business and operations. In addition, we may face claims based on the alleged theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of thirdparty trade secrets and other confidential information or end-user data that we obtain in conducting our business. Any such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our\nbusiness, and we could suffer losses, including the cost of product recalls and returns, and reputational harm. Furthermore, we have agreed to indemnify customers for certain IP\nrights claims against them. As a result of IP rights claims, we could:\n• pay monetary damages, including payments to satisfy indemnification obligations;\n• stop manufacturing, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products or technology subject to claims;\n• need to develop other products or technology not subject to claims, which could be time-consuming or costly; and/or\n• enter into settlement and license agreements, which agreements may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nThese IP rights claims could harm our competitive position, result in expenses, or require us to impair our assets. If we alter or stop production of affected items, our revenue\ncould be harmed.\nWe rely on access to third-party IP, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Many of our products include third-party technology and/or\nimplement industry standards, and may require licenses from third parties. Based on past experience and industry practice, we believe such licenses generally can be obtained\non commercially reasonable terms. However, there is no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use\nthird-party technology, or to license IP on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude us from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our\nfinancial condition and operating results.\nWe are subject to the risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings. We may face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, competition,\nand other issues on a global basis. As described in \"Note 20: Commitments and Contingencies\" within the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are engaged in a number of\nlitigation and regulatory matters. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages, or an injunction\nstopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An\nunfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, regardless of the outcome, litigation and\nregulatory proceedings can be costly, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations, and distracting to management.\nWE MUST ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE KEY EMPLOYEES.\nTo be competitive, we must attract, retain, and motivate executives and other key employees. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff, and\nsales representatives are critical to our business, and competition for experienced employees can be intense. To help attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, we use\nshare-based and other performance-based incentive awards such as RSUs and cash bonuses. Also key to our employee hiring and retention is our ability to build and maintain\nan inclusive business culture and be viewed as an employer of choice. If our share-based or other compensation programs and workplace culture cease to be viewed as\ncompetitive, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS.\nWe invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments. We make investments in public and private companies around the world to further\nour strategic objectives and support key business initiatives. Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable at the time of our initial investment. Companies in\nwhich we invest range from early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction to mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. The\nsuccess of our investment in any company is typically dependent on the company’s access to additional funding on favorable terms, or a liquidity event, such as a public offering\nor acquisition. If any of the companies in which we invest fail, we could lose all or part of our investment.\nOur acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic transactions could fail to achieve our financial or strategic objectives, disrupt our ongoing business, and adversely impact our\nresults of operations. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate opportunities, and enter into agreements for possible acquisitions,\ndivestitures, and other strategic transactions. These transactions involve numerous risks, including:\n• the transaction may not advance our business strategy and its anticipated benefits may never materialize;\n• we may experience disruption of our ongoing operations and our management’s attention may be diverted;\n• we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment, potentially resulting in an impairment;\n• we may be unable to retain key personnel of acquired businesses or may have difficulty integrating employees, business systems, and technology;\nOTHER KEY INFORMATION 51\nTable of Contents\n• we may not be able to identify opportunities in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us;\n• controls, processes, and procedures of acquired businesses may not adequately ensure compliance with laws and regulations, and we may fail to identify compliance issues\nor liabilities;\n• we may be unable to effectively enter new market segments through our strategic transactions or retain customers and partners of acquired businesses;\n• we may fail to identify the existence of unknown, underestimated, and/or undisclosed commitments or liabilities; and/or\n• we may fail to complete a transaction in a timely manner, if at all, due to our inability to obtain required government or other approvals, IP disputes or other litigation, difficulty\nin obtaining financing on terms acceptable to us, or other unforeseen factors.\nMoreover, our resources are limited and our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we may need to forgo the\nprospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our financial or strategic objectives.\nAny of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, particularly in the case of a large acquisition or\nseveral concurrent acquisitions.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO SALES-RELATED RISKS.\nWe face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties. We sell a significant portion of our products through third parties such as distributors, value-added\nresellers, and channel partners (collectively referred to as distributors), as well as OEMs, ODMs and Internet service providers. We depend on many distributors to help us create\nend-customer demand, provide technical support and other value-added services to customers, fill customer orders, and stock our products. We may rely on one or more key\ndistributors for a product, and a material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors or their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue. Our\nability to add or replace distributors for some of our products may be limited. In addition, our distributors' expertise in the determination and stocking of acceptable inventory\nlevels for some of our products may not be easily transferable to a new distributor; as a result, end customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a\ndistributor. Using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks, including competitive pressure and concentration, credit, and compliance risks. Distributors and other\nthird parties may sell products that compete with our products, and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to focus them on the sale of our products. They may\nface financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or\nsimilar laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business. Failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors and other\nthird parties may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position.\nWe receive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers. Collectively, our three largest customers accounted for approximately 40% of our net revenue\nin 2017 and 38% of our net revenue in 2016. We expect a small number of customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future. If\none of our key customers stops purchasing from us, materially reduces its demand for our products, or delays its orders for our products, we may experience a reduction in\nrevenue, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition. For more information about our customers, including customers who accounted for greater than 10%\nof our net consolidated revenue, see \"Note 4: Operating Segments\" within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe face risks related to business transactions with U.S. government entities. We receive proceeds from services and products we provide to the U.S. government. U.S.\ngovernment demand and payment may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations. U.S. government contracts are subject to oversight, including\nspecial rules on accounting, IP rights, expenses, reviews, information handling, and security. Failure to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and\nsanctions, including termination of contracts, fines, and suspensions, or debarment from future business with the U.S. government.\nCHANGES IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE MAY REDUCE OUR NET INCOME.\nA number of factors may increase our effective tax rates, which could reduce our net income, including:\n• changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed;\n• the resolution of issues arising from tax audits;\n• changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances;\n• adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns;\n• increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill;\n• changes in available tax credits;\n• changes in our ability to secure new or renew existing tax holidays and incentives;\n• changes in U.S. federal, state, or foreign tax laws or their interpretation, including changes in the U.S. to the taxation of manufacturing enterprises and of non-U.S. income\nand expenses;\n• changes in accounting standards; and\n• our decision to repatriate non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for local country withholding taxes incurred upon repatriation.\nOTHER KEY INFORMATION 52\nTable of Contents\nWE MAY HAVE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE AMOUNT AND FREQUENCY OF OUR STOCK REPURCHASES.\nThe amount, timing, and execution of our stock repurchase program may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes—such as investing in our\nbusiness, including operational spending, capital spending, and acquisitions, and returning cash to our stockholders as dividend payments—and because of changes in cash\nflows, tax laws, and the market price of our common stock.",

      "item1a":"The following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could\ndecline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to\nbe immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and\nhistorical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Refer also to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including in\nMD&A and our financial statements and the related notes.\nCHANGES IN PRODUCT DEMAND CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.\nDemand for our products is variable and hard to predict. Our products are used in different market segments, and demand for our products may vary within or among the market\nsegments served by our PC-centric and data-centric businesses. It is difficult to forecast these changes and their impact. For example, demand for our platform products may\nincrease in one or more market segments while decreasing in others. Changes in the demand for our products, particularly our CCG and DCG platform products, may reduce our\nrevenue, lower our gross margin, or require us to write down the value of our assets.\nImportant factors that could lead to variation in the demand for our products include:\n• business conditions, including downturns in the market segments in which we operate, or in the global or regional economies;\n• consumer confidence or income levels, and the levels of customer capital spending, which may be impacted by changes in market conditions, including changes in\ngovernment borrowing, taxation, or spending policies; the credit market; or expected inflation, employment, and energy or other commodity prices;\n• our ability to timely introduce competitive products;\n• competitive and pricing pressures, including new product introductions and other actions taken by competitors;\n• the level of our customers’ inventories;\n• customer order patterns, including order cancellations, which may be affected by maturing product cycles, disruptions affecting customers, and other factors;\n• market acceptance and industry support of our new and maturing products, including the introduction and availability of products used together with our products; and\n• customer product needs and emerging technology trends, including changes in the levels and nature of customer and end-user computing workloads.\nOTHER KEY INFORMATION 49\nTable of Contents\nDue to the complexity of our manufacturing operations, we may be unable to timely respond to fluctuations in demand and we may incur significant charges and costs. Because\nwe own and operate high-tech fabrication facilities, our operations have high costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term, including our costs related to utilization of\nexisting facilities, facility construction and equipment, R&D, and the employment and training of a highly skilled workforce. If product demand decreases or we fail to forecast\ndemand accurately, we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges, which would lower our gross margin. If the demand decrease is prolonged, our\nmanufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. We may\nalso be required to shorten the useful lives of under-used facilities and equipment and accelerate depreciation. Conversely, if product demand increases, we may be unable to\nadd capacity fast enough to meet market demand, which could result in a loss of revenue opportunities or market share, legal claims, and/or damage to customer relationships.\nWe face significant competition. The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market developments, changes in industry\nstandards, changes in customer needs, and frequent product introductions and improvements. If we do not anticipate and respond to these developments, our competitive\nposition may weaken, and our products or technologies might be uncompetitive or become obsolete. Our products primarily compete based on performance, energy efficiency,\nintegration, ease-of-use, innovative design, features, price, quality, reliability, security features, software ecosystem and developer support, time-to-market, brand recognition,\ncustomer support and customization, and availability. The importance of these factors may vary by product—for example, if we do not continue to introduce data center platform\nproducts with performance leadership, our competitive position and market segment share in our DCG business may be adversely affected. We will not realize our strategic goal\nto become the leading end-to-end provider for the new data-centric era of computing if our products do not meet our customers’ needs in an increasingly competitive landscape.\nWe face intense competition across our product portfolio from companies offering platform products; accelerator products such as GPUs, ASICs, application-specific standard\nproducts, and FPGAs; memory and storage products; connectivity products such as cellular modems; and other semiconductor products. Some of these competitors have\ndeveloped or utilize competing computing architectures for specific market segments or applications, and these architectures can produce beneficial network effects for\ncompetitors if an ecosystem of customers and application developers for such architectures grows at scale. We also compete with internally developed semiconductors from\nOEMs, cloud service providers, and others, including customers, and with new entrants. Introduction of competitive new products, aggressive pricing, and other actions taken by\ncompetitors could harm demand for our products and our business. Additionally, a number of business combinations and strategic partnerships in the semiconductor industry\nhave occurred over the last several years, and more could occur in the future. Consolidation could lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any of which could negatively\naffect our financial results.\nTo compete successfully, we must maintain a successful R&D effort, develop new products and production processes, and improve our existing products and processes ahead of\ncompetitors. For example, we invest substantially in our network of manufacturing and assembly and test facilities, including the construction of new fabrication facilities to\nsupport smaller transistor geometries, and in the development of the advanced manufacturing technologies to produce such transistors. We do not expect all of our R&D\ninvestments to be successful. We may be unable to develop and market new products successfully, and the products and technologies we invest in and develop may not be well\nreceived by customers. Our R&D investments may not contribute to our future operating results for several years, if at all, and such contributions may not meet our expectations\nor even cover the costs of such investments. Additionally, the products and technologies offered by others may affect demand for, or pricing of, our products.\nIf we are not able to compete effectively, our financial results will be adversely affected, including reduced revenue and gross margin, and we may be required to accelerate the\nwrite-down of the value of certain assets.\nOur investments in new businesses, products, and technologies are inherently risky and may not succeed. In recent years, in connection with our strategic transformation to a\ndata-centric company, we have entered new areas and introduced adjacent products in programmable solutions, AI, and autonomous driving. We have also expanded our\nadjacent product offerings in client computing, the data center, the Internet of Things, and memory, with offerings such as modems, silicon photonics solutions, and Intel Optane\ntechnology products. As a result, we face new sources of competition, including, in certain of these market segments, from incumbent competitors with established technologies\nand customer bases and greater brand recognition. These developing products and market segments may require significant investment, may not grow as significantly as\nprojected, or at all, or may utilize technologies that are different from the ones that we develop and manufacture, and we may not realize an adequate return on our investments.\nFor example, AI and machine learning are increasingly driving innovations in technology, but if they fail to deliver the benefits anticipated, or if our customers use competing\ntechnologies for these workloads, we may not realize a return on our investments in these areas. To be successful, we need to cultivate new industry relationships with\ncustomers and partners in these market segments. In addition, we must continually improve the cost, performance, integration, and energy efficiency of our products, as well as\nexpand our software capabilities to provide customers with comprehensive computing solutions. Despite our ongoing efforts, there is no guarantee that we will achieve or\nmaintain market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments.\nChanges in the mix of products sold may impact our financial results. Our pricing and margins vary across our products and market segments due in part to marketability of our\nproducts and differences in their features or manufacturing costs. For example, our platform product offerings range from lower-priced and entry-level platforms, such as those\nbased on Intel Atom processors, to higher-end platforms based on Intel Xeon processors. Our adjacent products also typically have significantly lower margins than our higherpriced platform products. If demand shifts from our higher-priced to lower-priced platform products in any of our market segments, or if our adjacent products represent an\nincreasingly greater share of our mix of products sold, our gross margin percentage may decrease.\nOTHER KEY INFORMATION 50\nTable of Contents\nWE OPERATE GLOBALLY AND ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS IN MANY JURISDICTIONS.\nGlobal or regional conditions may harm our financial results. We have manufacturing, assembly and test, R&D, sales, and other operations in many countries, and some of our\nbusiness activities may be concentrated in one or more geographic areas. Moreover, sales outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 84% of our revenue for the fiscal year\nended December 29, 2018. As a result, our operations and our financial results, including our ability to manufacture, assemble and test, design, develop, or sell products, and the\ndemand for our products, may be adversely affected by a number of global and regional factors outside of our control.\nAdverse changes in global or regional economic conditions, including recession or slowing growth, changes or uncertainty in fiscal or monetary policy, higher interest rates,\ntighter credit, inflation, lower capital expenditures by businesses including on IT infrastructure, increases in unemployment, and lower consumer confidence and spending, could\nsignificantly harm demand for our products and make it more challenging to forecast our operating results and make business decisions, including regarding prioritization of\ninvestments in our business. An economic downturn or increased uncertainty may also lead to increased credit and collectibility risks, higher borrowing costs or limits on our\naccess to capital markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our suppliers, failures of counterparties and other financial institutions, and declines in the value of our financial\ninstruments.\nInternational trade disputes may result in increased tariffs, trade barriers, and other protectionist measures that could increase our manufacturing costs, make our products less\ncompetitive, reduce consumer demand, or impede or slow the movement of our goods across borders. Increasing protectionism and economic nationalism may lead to further\nchanges in trade policy, domestic sourcing initiatives, or other formal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our products in some markets.\nWe may be adversely affected by other global and regional factors, including:\n• geopolitical and security issues, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, political instability, human rights concerns, and terrorist activity;\n• natural disasters, public health issues, and other catastrophic events;\n• inefficient infrastructure and other disruptions, such as supply chain interruptions and large-scale outages or unreliable provision of services from utilities, transportation, data\nhosting, or telecommunications providers;\n• formal or informal imposition of new or revised export, import, or doing-business regulations, including trade sanctions and tariffs, which could be changed without notice;\n• government restrictions on, or nationalization of our operations in any country, or restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings from a particular country;\n• differing employment practices and labor issues;\n• ineffective legal protection of our IP rights in certain countries;\n• local business and cultural factors that differ from our current standards and practices;\n• continuing uncertainty regarding social, political, immigration, and tax and trade policies in the U.S. and abroad, including as a result of the United Kingdom's vote to\nwithdraw from the European Union; and\n• fluctuations in the market values of our domestic and international investments, which can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, interest rate\nchanges, financial results, political risk, sovereign risk, or other factors.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations worldwide that may differ among jurisdictions, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to: IP ownership and\ninfringement; tax; import and export requirements; anti-corruption; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition;\nadvertising; employment; product regulations; environment, health, and safety requirements; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements may be onerous and\nexpensive, and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively. For example, unfavorable developments with evolving laws and regulations worldwide related to 5G or\nautonomous driving technology may limit global adoption, impede our strategy, and negatively impact our long-term expectations for our investments in these areas. Although we\nhave policies, controls, and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, and/or\nagents will not violate such laws or our policies. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees;\nprohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation.\nWe may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency exchange rates. Although\nmost of our sales occur in U.S. dollars, expenses may be paid in local currencies. An increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our\nproducts in those markets outside the U.S. where we sell in dollars, and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of expenses such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing\nexpenses, as well as overseas capital expenditures. We also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies. Our hedging programs may not be effective to\noffset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse impact of currency exchange rate movements; therefore, changes in exchange rates could harm our results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nOTHER KEY INFORMATION 51\nTable of Contents\nCatastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. Our operations and business, and those of our customers and suppliers, could\nbe disrupted by natural disasters; industrial accidents; public health issues; cybersecurity incidents; interruptions of service from utilities, transportation, telecommunications, or IT\nsystems providers; or other catastrophic events. Our headquarters and many of our operations and facilities are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural\ndisasters. Global climate change may result in certain natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise, and\nflooding, and could disrupt the availability of water necessary for the operation of our fabrication facilities located in semi-arid regions. Catastrophic events could make it difficult\nor impossible to manufacture or deliver products to our customers, receive production materials from our suppliers, or perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our\nrevenue and require significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. While we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to enable us to recover from\nnatural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business, some of our systems are not fully redundant and we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us\nfrom all such disruptions. Furthermore, even if our operations are unaffected or recover quickly, if our customers cannot timely resume their own operations due to a catastrophic\nevent, they may reduce or cancel their orders, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks. The types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability,\ncost, and decisions with respect to risk retention. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions. In addition, one or more of our insurance providers may be\nunable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nDamage to our reputation could damage our business. Our reputation is a critical factor in our relationships with customers, employees, governments, suppliers, and other\nstakeholders. If we fail to address, or appear to fail to address, issues that give rise to reputational risk, including those described throughout this \"Risk Factors\" section, we could\nsignificantly harm our reputation and our brands. Our reputation may also be damaged by how we respond to corporate crises. Corporate crises can arise from catastrophic\nevents as well as from incidents involving unethical behavior or misconduct; product quality, security, or safety issues; allegations of legal noncompliance; internal control failures;\ncorporate governance issues; data breaches; workplace safety incidents; environmental incidents; the use of our products for illegal or objectionable applications; marketing\npractices; media statements; the conduct of our suppliers or representatives; and other issues or incidents that, whether actual or perceived, result in adverse publicity. If we fail\nto respond quickly and effectively to address such crises, the ensuing negative public reaction could significantly harm our reputation and our brands and could lead to increases\nin litigation claims and asserted damages or subject us to regulatory actions or restrictions.\nDamage to our reputation could reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business and operating environment. It could reduce investor confidence in us,\nadversely affecting our stock price. It may also limit our ability to be seen as an employer of choice when competing for highly skilled employees. Moreover, repairing our\nreputation and brands may be difficult, time-consuming, and expensive.\nWE ARE VULNERABLE TO PRODUCT AND MANUFACTURING-RELATED RISKS.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing process technology. Production of integrated circuits is a complex process.\nRealizing the economics of Moore’s Law is a strategic priority, and we are continually engaged in the development of next-generation process technologies at increasingly\nadvanced nodes. We may not be successful or efficient in developing or implementing new process nodes and production processes. Our efforts to innovate involve significant\nexpense and carry inherent risks, including difficulties in designing and developing such next-generation process technologies, failures to realize the expected benefits of nextgeneration process technologies, and investments in manufacturing assets and facilities that are made years in advance of the process node introduction.\nRisks inherent in the development of next-generation process technologies include production timing delays, lower-than-anticipated manufacturing yields, and product defects\nand errata. For example, we announced earlier in 2018 that volume production on our 10nm process technology was being delayed from the second half of 2018 into 2019. We\nhave made progress on improving 10nm yields during 2018, and we expect 10nm-based volume client systems on retail shelves for the 2019 holiday season. However, the\ndelays in our transition to next-generation process technology may allow competitors to take advantage of potential improvements in performance, energy efficiency, cost and/or\nother features that may be offered by new process technologies developed by third-party foundries. Furthermore, without the benefit of next-generation process nodes, including\nadditional competitive features on our products may result in larger die size products, manufacturing supply constraints and increased product costs.\nDisruptions in the production process can also result from errors, defects in materials, delays in obtaining or revising operating permits and licenses, interruptions in our supply of\nmaterials or resources, and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents, maintenance issues, or unsafe working conditions—all of which could\naffect the timing of production ramps and yields.\nProduction issues can lead to increased costs and may affect our ability to meet product demand, which could adversely impact our business and the results of operations. In\naddition, if we face delays in the timing of our product introductions, we could become less competitive and lose revenue opportunities, and our gross margin could be adversely\naffected because we incur significant costs up front in the product development stage and earn revenue to offset these costs over time.\nOTHER KEY INFORMATION 52\nTable of Contents\nWe face supply chain risks. Thousands of suppliers provide materials and equipment that we use in production and other aspects of our business. Where possible, we seek to\nhave several sources of supply. However, for certain materials and equipment, including photolithography tools, we may rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, or upon\nsuppliers in a single location. In addition, supplier consolidation or business failures could impact the nature, quality, availability, and pricing of the products and services available\nto us. The inability of suppliers to deliver necessary production materials or equipment could disrupt our production processes and make it more difficult for us to implement our\nbusiness strategy. Production could be disrupted by the unavailability of resources, such as water, silicon, electricity, gases, and other materials. The unavailability or reduced\navailability of materials or resources may require us to reduce production or incur additional costs, which could harm our business and results of operations. Our manufacturing\noperations and ability to meet product demand may also be impacted by IP or other litigation between our suppliers, where an injunction against Intel or a supplier could interrupt\nthe availability of goods or services supplied to Intel by others.\nWe also rely on third-party providers to manufacture and assemble and test certain components or products. These have included components and products related to\nnetworking, communications, programmable semiconductor solutions, and memory, and may include these and other components and products in the future. If any of these third\nparties are unable to perform these services on a timely or cost-effective basis, in sufficient volumes, or at all, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions or incur additional\ncosts that could adversely affect our business and financial results. For example, while we have an agreement providing for the supply of 3D XPoint memory from IMFT for a\nperiod following the close of Micron’s purchase of our interest in IMFT, we will need to fund and develop internal manufacturing options to continue 3D XPoint memory supply in\nthe longer term.\nIn addition, increased regulation or stakeholder expectations regarding responsible sourcing practices could cause our compliance costs to increase or result in publicity that\nnegatively affects our reputation. Moreover, given that we use many materials in the manufacturing of our products and rely on many suppliers to provide these materials, but do\nnot directly control the procurement or employment practices of such suppliers, we could be subject to similar financial or reputational risks as a result of our suppliers' conduct.\nWe are subject to the risks of product defects, errata, or other product issues. Product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications) may result from problems in\nour product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test processes. Components and products we purchase or license from third-party suppliers, or attain through\nacquisitions, may also contain defects. We could face risks if products that we design, manufacture, or sell, or that include our technology, cause personal injury or property\ndamage, even where the cause is unrelated to product defects or errata. These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, market segments,\ntechnologies, or applications, including transportation and autonomous driving, healthcare, communications, and financial services, and other industrial, infrastructure, and\nconsumer uses. Costs from defects, errata, or other product issues could include:\n• writing off some or all of the value of inventory;\n• recalling products that have been shipped;\n• providing product replacements or modifications;\n• reimbursing customers for certain costs they incur;\n• defending against litigation and/or paying resulting damages; and\n• paying fines imposed by regulatory agencies.\nThese costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin, and result in delay or loss of revenue. Any product defects, errata, or other issues could also\ndamage our reputation, negatively affect product demand, delay product releases, or result in legal liability. The announcement of product defects or errata could cause\ncustomers to purchase products from competitors. Any of these occurrences could harm our business and financial results. In addition, although we maintain liability insurance,\nour coverage has certain exclusions and/or may not adequately cover liabilities incurred. Our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim, and losses not\ncovered by insurance could be large, which could harm our financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks associated with environmental, health, and safety regulations. The manufacturing and assembly and test of our products require the use of hazardous\nmaterials that are subject to a broad array of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in:\n• regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities;\n• suspension of production;\n• alteration of our manufacturing and assembly and test processes;\n• damage to our reputation; and\n• restrictions on our operations or sales.\nOur failure to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, or disposal of hazardous materials could lead to increased costs or future liabilities. Our\nability to expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future may be impeded by environmental regulations, such as air quality and wastewater requirements.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire additional pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product designs, or incur other expenses.\nRegulations in response to climate change could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution requirements, and increased compliance and energy costs.\nMany new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may be subject to regulation under environmental laws and regulations. These restrictions could harm our\nbusiness and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processes.\nOTHER KEY INFORMATION 53\nTable of Contents\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY RISKS.\nWe face risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents. We regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet, or to introduce malicious\nsoftware, to our IT systems. Additionally, individuals or organizations, including malicious hackers, state-sponsored organizations, insider threats including employees and thirdparty service providers, or intruders into our physical facilities, may attempt to gain unauthorized access and corrupt the processes of hardware and software products that we\nmanufacture and services we provide. Due to the widespread use of our products, we are a frequent target of computer hackers and organizations that intend to sabotage, take\ncontrol of, or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other processes, products, and services. We are also a target of malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our\nnetwork or data centers or those of our customers or end users; steal proprietary information related to our business, products, employees, and customers; or interrupt our\nsystems and services or those of our customers or others. Such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication, and if successful, could expose us and the\naffected parties to risk of loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information or disruptions of our business operations. Our IT infrastructure also includes products and\nservices provided by third parties, and these providers may experience breaches of their systems and products that impact the security of our systems and our proprietary or\nconfidential information.\nFrom time to time, we encounter intrusions or unauthorized access to our network, products, services, or infrastructure. To date, none have resulted in any material adverse\nimpact to our business or operations. Such incidents, whether or not successful, could result in our incurring significant costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems,\nwriting down inventory value, implementing additional threat protection measures, providing modifications to our products and services, defending against litigation, responding to\nregulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, providing customers with incentives to maintain the business relationship, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third\nparties, as well as reputational harm. In addition, these threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing\nadequate preventative measures. While we seek to detect and investigate all unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network, products, and services, and to prevent their\nrecurrence where practicable through changes to our internal processes and tools and/or changes or updates to our products and services, we remain potentially vulnerable to\nadditional known or unknown threats. In some instances, we, our customers, and the users of our products and services may be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and\neffects.\nWe face risks related to security vulnerabilities in our products. We or third parties regularly identify security vulnerabilities with respect to our processors and other products, as\nwell as the operating systems and workloads running on them. As we have become a more data-centric company, our processors and other products are being used in more and\ndifferent critical application areas that create new or increased cybersecurity and privacy risks, including applications that gather and process large amounts of data, such as the\ncloud or Internet of Things, and critical infrastructure and automotive applications. The security vulnerabilities identified in our processors include a category known as sidechannel exploits, such as the variants referred to as “Spectre” and “Meltdown.” Additional categories and variants have been and may continue to be identified. Publicity about\nthese and other security vulnerabilities and attempted or successful exploits, whether accurate or inaccurate, may result in increased attempts by third parties to identify\nadditional vulnerabilities. Although vulnerabilities have often been discovered and mitigated in advance of being exploited, it is possible that vulnerabilities may not be mitigated\nbefore they become known. We, our customers, and the users of our products may not promptly learn of or be able to fully assess the magnitude or effects of a vulnerability,\nincluding the extent, if any, to which a vulnerability has been exploited. Subsequent events or new information could develop that changes our assessment of the impact of a\nsecurity vulnerability, including additional information learned as we develop and deploy mitigations or updates, become aware of additional variants, evaluate the\ncompetitiveness of existing and new products, address future warranty or other claims or customer satisfaction considerations, as well as developments in the course of any\nlitigation or regulatory inquiries or actions over these matters.\nMitigation techniques designed to address security vulnerabilities, including software and firmware updates or other preventative measures, may not be available on a timely\nbasis—or at all—or may not operate as intended or effectively resolve vulnerabilities for all applications. In addition, we may be required to rely on third parties, including\nhardware, software, and services vendors, as well as our customers and end users, to develop and deploy mitigation techniques, and the availability, effectiveness, and\nperformance impact of mitigation techniques may depend solely or in part on the actions of these third parties in determining whether and how to develop and deploy mitigations.\nWe and such third parties may make prioritization decisions about which vulnerabilities to address, which could delay or limit development or deployment of a mitigation and\nharm our reputation. Security vulnerabilities and/or mitigation techniques may result in adverse performance effects, reboots, system instability or unavailability, loss of\nfunctionality, data loss or corruption, unpredictable system behavior, decisions by customers and end users to limit or change the applications in which they use our products or\nproduct features, or the misappropriation of data by third parties.\nSecurity vulnerabilities and any limitations of, or adverse effects resulting from, mitigation techniques can adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, customer\nrelationships, prospects, and reputation in a number of ways, any of which may be material. For example, whether or not they involve attempted or successful exploits, they may\nresult in our incurring significant costs related to developing and deploying updates and mitigations, writing down inventory value, defending against product claims and litigation,\nresponding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, addressing customer satisfaction considerations, providing product replacements or modifications, or taking other\nremedial steps with respect to third parties. Adverse publicity about security vulnerabilities or mitigations could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce\ndemand for our products and services. These effects may be greater to the extent that competing products are not susceptible to the same vulnerabilities or if vulnerabilities can\nbe more effectively mitigated in competing products. Moreover, third parties may release information regarding potential vulnerabilities of our products before mitigations are\navailable, which, in turn, could lead to attempted or successful exploits, adversely affect our ability to introduce mitigations, or otherwise harm our business and reputation. For\nexample, information on the “Spectre” and “Meltdown” side-channel variants was prematurely reported publicly before mitigation techniques to address all vulnerabilities were\nmade widely available, and certain of the mitigation techniques did not operate as intended.\nOTHER KEY INFORMATION 54\nTable of Contents\nWe may be subject to theft, loss, or misuse of personal data about our employees, customers, or other third parties, which could increase our expenses, damage our reputation,\nor result in legal or regulatory proceedings. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly\nincreased business and security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and\ncreating a complex regulatory compliance environment. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant, and\nnoncompliance could expose us to significant monetary penalties, damage to our reputation, suspension of online services or sites in certain countries, and even criminal\nsanctions. Even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in audits, regulatory\ninquiries, or proceedings against us by governmental entities or other third parties.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO IP RISKS AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS.\nWe may be unable to enforce or protect our IP rights. We regard our patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and other IP rights as important to the success of our business. We rely\non IP law—as well as confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers, employees, technology development partners, and others—to protect our IP rights. Our ability\nto enforce these rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our IP rights in various countries. Enforcement may be costly and\ntime-consuming and may divert management attention. When we seek to enforce our rights, we may be subject to claims that our IP rights are invalid, not enforceable, or\nlicensed to an opposing party. Our assertion of IP rights may result in another party seeking to assert claims against us, which could harm our business. Governments may adopt\nregulations—and governments or courts may render decisions—requiring compulsory licensing of IP rights, or governments may require products to meet standards that favor\nlocal companies. Our inability to enforce our IP rights under any of these circumstances may harm our competitive position and business. In addition, the theft or unauthorized\nuse or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the\nvalue of our investment in R&D, product development, and marketing could be reduced.\nOur licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives may allow competitors to use our patent rights. Technology companies often bilaterally license patents\nbetween each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements. Our competitors may have licenses to our patents, and under current case law, some of the licenses\nmay exhaust our patent rights as to licensed product sales under some circumstances. Our participation in industry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives may\nrequire us to license our patents to companies that adopt industry-standard specifications. Depending on the rules of the organization, government regulations, or court\ndecisions, we might have to grant licenses to our patents for little or no cost, and as a result, we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others, our costs of enforcing\nour licenses or protecting our patents may increase, and the value of our IP rights may be impaired.\nThird parties may assert claims based on IP rights against us or our products, which could harm our business. We may face claims based on IP rights from individuals and\ncompanies, including claims from those who have aggregated patents acquired from multiple sources to form a new, larger portfolio to assert claims against us and other\ncompanies. Additionally, large patent portfolio owners may divest portions of their portfolios to more than one individual or company, increasing the number of parties who own IP\nrights previously all held by a single party. We are typically engaged in a number of disputes involving IP rights. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of\nothers, regardless of their merits, could cause us to incur large costs to respond to, defend, and resolve the claims, and they may divert the efforts and attention of our\nmanagement and technical personnel from our business and operations. In addition, we may face claims based on the alleged theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of thirdparty trade secrets or confidential information or end-user data that we obtain in conducting our business. Any such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business, and\nwe could suffer losses, including the cost of product recalls and returns, and reputational harm. Furthermore, we have agreed to indemnify customers for certain IP rights claims\nagainst them. IP rights claims against our customers could also limit demand for our products or disrupt our customers’ businesses, which could in turn adversely affect our\nresults of operations.\nAs a result of IP rights claims, we could:\n• pay monetary damages, including payments to satisfy indemnification obligations, or royalties;\n• stop manufacturing, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products or technology subject to claims;\n• need to develop other products or technology not subject to claims, which could be time-consuming or costly; and/or\n• enter into settlement and license agreements, which agreements may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nThese IP rights claims could harm our competitive position, result in expenses, or require us to impair our assets. If we alter or stop production of affected items, our revenue\ncould be harmed.\nWe rely on access to third-party IP, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Many of our products include third-party technology and/or\nimplement industry standards, and may require licenses from third parties. Based on past experience and industry practice, we believe such licenses generally can be obtained\non commercially reasonable terms. However, there is no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use\nthird-party technology, or to license IP on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude us from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our\nfinancial condition and operating results.\nOTHER KEY INFORMATION 55\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings. We may face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, competition,\ncommercial, IP, and other issues on a global basis. As described in \"Note 20: Commitments and Contingencies\" within the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are engaged in\na number of litigation and regulatory matters. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages, or an\ninjunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of\npatents. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, regardless of the outcome,\nlitigation and regulatory proceedings can be costly, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations, and distracting to management.\nWE MUST ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE KEY EMPLOYEES.\nTo be competitive, we must attract, retain, and motivate executives and other key employees. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff, and\nsales representatives are critical to our business, and competition for highly skilled employees in our industry can be intense. In addition, changes in immigration policies may\nimpair our ability to recruit and hire technical and professional talent. Changes in the interpretation and application of employment-related laws to our workforce practices may\nalso result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our changing workforce needs. To help attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, we use sharebased awards, such as RSUs, and performance-based cash incentive awards. Our employee hiring and retention also depend on our ability to build and maintain a diverse and\ninclusive workplace culture and be viewed as an employer of choice. If our share-based or other compensation programs and workplace culture cease to be viewed as\ncompetitive, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. Furthermore, changes in our management\nteam may disrupt our business, and the failure to successfully transition and assimilate key employees could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS.\nOur acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic transactions could fail to achieve our financial or strategic objectives, disrupt our ongoing business, and adversely impact our\nresults of operations. In furtherance of our business strategy, we routinely evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements for possible acquisitions, divestitures, and other\nstrategic transactions. These transactions involve numerous risks, including:\n• we may not be able to identify opportunities in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us;\n• the transaction may not advance our business strategy and its anticipated benefits may never materialize;\n• we may experience disruption of our ongoing operations and our management’s attention may be diverted;\n• we may fail to complete a transaction in a timely manner, if at all, due to our inability to obtain required government or other approvals, IP disputes or other litigation, difficulty\nin obtaining financing on terms acceptable to us, or other unforeseen factors;\n• we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment, potentially resulting in an impairment of goodwill and other assets, and restructuring charges;\n• we may be unable to effectively enter new market segments through our strategic transactions or retain customers and partners of acquired businesses;\n• we may be unable to retain key personnel of acquired businesses or may have difficulty integrating employees, business systems, and technology;\n• controls, processes, and procedures of acquired businesses may not adequately ensure compliance with laws and regulations, and we may fail to identify compliance issues\nor liabilities;\n• we may fail to identify, or may underestimate, commitments, liabilities, and other risks associated with acquired businesses or assets; and/or\n• our acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or significant additional debt.\nMoreover, our resources are limited and our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we may need to forgo the\nprospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our financial or strategic objectives.\nAny of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, particularly in the case of a large acquisition or\nseveral concurrent acquisitions.\nWe invest in public and private companies and may not realize a return on our investments. We make investments in public and private companies around the world to further\nour strategic and financial objectives and to support certain key business initiatives. Companies in which we invest range from early-stage companies still defining their strategic\ndirection to mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable and illiquid at the time of\nour initial investment, and we may not be able to achieve a return, if any, in a timely fashion. Our ability to realize a return on our investment in a private company, if any, is\ntypically dependent on the company participating in a liquidity event, such as a public offering or acquisition. To the extent our investments are in marketable equity securities, as\nis typically the case for our public company investments, fluctuations in the fair value of those securities are recognized as gains or losses in our income statement, and\nconsequently, declines in the fair value of these investments can reduce our net income. If any of the companies in which we invest are not successful, which may include\nfailures to achieve business objectives as well as bankruptcy filings, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment.\nOTHER KEY INFORMATION 56\nTable of Contents\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO SALES-RELATED RISKS.\nWe face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties. We sell a significant portion of our products through third parties such as distributors, value-added\nresellers, and channel partners (collectively referred to as distributors), as well as OEMs and ODMs. We depend on many distributors to help us create end-customer demand,\nprovide technical support and other value-added services to customers, fill customer orders, and stock our products. We may rely on one or more key distributors for a product,\nand a material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors or their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue. Our ability to add or replace\ndistributors for some of our products may be limited. In addition, our distributors' expertise in the determination and stocking of acceptable inventory levels for some of our\nproducts may not be easily transferable to a new distributor; as a result, end customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a distributor. Using third parties\nfor distribution exposes us to many risks, including competitive pressure and concentration, credit, and compliance risks. Distributors and other third parties may sell products\nthat compete with our products, and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to focus them on the sale of our products. They may face financial difficulties,\nincluding bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws by distributors or\nother third-party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business. Failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors and other third parties may reduce sales,\nincrease expenses, and weaken our competitive position.\nWe receive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers. Collectively, our three largest customers accounted for approximately 39% of our net revenue\nin 2018 and 40% of our net revenue in 2017. We expect a small number of customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future.\nIndustry trends, such as the increasing shift of data center workloads to the public cloud, may increase customer concentration for certain of our data-centric businesses. If one\nof our key customers stops purchasing from us, materially reduces its demand for our products, or delays its orders for our products, we may experience a reduction in revenue,\nwhich could harm our results of operations and financial condition. To the extent we differentiate our products through customization to meet customer specifications, order\nchanges, delays, or cancellations may result in non-recoverable costs. For more information about our customers, including customers who accounted for greater than 10% of\nour net consolidated revenue, see \"Note 4: Operating Segments\" within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe face risks related to business transactions with U.S. government entities. We receive proceeds from services and products we provide to the U.S. government. U.S.\ngovernment demand and payment may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations. U.S. government contracts are subject to oversight, including\nspecial rules on accounting, IP rights, expenses, reviews, information handling, and security. Failure to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and\nsanctions, including termination of contracts, fines, and suspensions, or debarment from future business with the U.S. government.\nCHANGES IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE MAY REDUCE OUR NET INCOME.\nA number of factors may increase our effective tax rates, which could reduce our net income, including:\n• changes in the volume and mix of profits earned across jurisdictions with varying tax rates;\n• the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, including payment of interest and penalties;\n• changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances;\n• adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns;\n• increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill;\n• changes in available tax credits;\n• changes in our ability to secure new or renew existing tax holidays and incentives;\n• changes in U.S. federal, state, or foreign tax laws or their interpretation, including changes in the U.S. to the taxation of manufacturing enterprises and of non-U.S. income\nand expenses;\n• changes in accounting standards; and\n• our decision to repatriate non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for local country withholding taxes incurred upon repatriation.\nWE MAY HAVE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE AMOUNT AND FREQUENCY OF OUR STOCK REPURCHASES.\nWe are not obligated to make repurchases under our stock repurchase program, and the amount, timing, and execution of our repurchases may fluctuate based on our priorities\nfor the use of cash for other purposes—such as investing in our business, including operational spending, capital spending, and acquisitions, and returning cash to our\nstockholders as dividend payments—and because of changes in cash flows, tax laws, and the market price of our common stock",

      "item1a":"The following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could\ndecline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to\nbe immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and\nhistorical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Refer also to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including in\nMD&A and our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes.\nCHANGES IN PRODUCT DEMAND CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.\nDemand for our products is variable and hard to predict. Our products are used in different market segments, and demand for our products varies within or among the market\nsegments served by our PC-centric and data-centric businesses. It is difficult to forecast these changes and their impact. For example, in the first half of 2019, customers of our\nDCG business worked through inventory and absorbed computing capacity purchased in 2018, leading to a year over year decline in DCG platform revenue in the first half,\nfollowed by growth in DCG platform demand and revenue in the second half of 2019. Changes in the demand for our products, particularly our CCG and DCG platform products,\ncan reduce our revenue, lower our gross margin, or require us to write down the value of our assets.\nImportant factors that lead to variation in the demand for our products include:\n• business conditions, including downturns in the market segments in which we operate, or in the global or regional economies;\n• consumer confidence or income levels, and the levels of customer capital spending, which may be impacted by changes in market conditions, including changes in\ngovernment borrowing, taxation, or spending policies; the credit market; or expected inflation, employment, and energy or other commodity prices;\n• our ability to timely introduce competitive products;\n• competitive and pricing pressures, including new product introductions and other actions taken by competitors;\n• the level of our customers’ inventories and computing capacity;\n• customer order patterns, including order cancellations, which can be affected by maturing product cycles for our products, customers’ products, and related products such as\noperating system upgrade cycles; disruptions affecting customers; and other factors;\n• market acceptance and industry support of our new and maturing products, including the introduction and availability of products used together with our products; and\n• customer product needs and emerging technology trends, including changes in the levels and nature of customer and end-user computing workloads.\nOTHER KEY INFORMATION 50\nTable of Contents\nDue to the complexity of our manufacturing operations, we are not always able to timely respond to fluctuations in demand and we may incur significant charges and costs.\nBecause we own and operate high-tech fabrication facilities, our operations have high costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term, including our costs related to\nutilization of existing facilities, facility construction and equipment, R&D, and the employment and training of a highly skilled workforce. To the extent product demand decreases\nor we fail to forecast demand accurately, we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges, which would lower our gross margin. To the extent the\ndemand decrease is prolonged, our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which\nwould increase our expenses. We may also be required to shorten the useful lives of under-used facilities and equipment and accelerate depreciation. Conversely, to the extent\nproduct demand increases or we fail to forecast accurately and produce the mix of products demanded, we may be unable to add capacity or increase production fast enough to\nmeet market demand, which can result in a loss of revenue opportunities or market share, legal claims, and/or damage to customer relationships. For example, we have been\nexperiencing supply constraints and have been prioritizing production of our server and high-performance PC products, which during 2019 contributed to loss of share in the\nvalue end of the PC market, where we were short of supply while demand remained healthy.\nWe face significant competition. The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market developments; changes in industry\nstandards; changes in customer and end-user needs, expectations, and preferences; and frequent product introductions and improvements. If we do not anticipate and respond\nto these developments, our competitive position can weaken, and our products or technologies can become uncompetitive or obsolete. Our competitive environment has\nintensified, and we expect it to continue to do so in the future.\nOur products primarily compete based on performance, energy efficiency, integration, ease-of-use, innovative design, features, price, quality, reliability, security, software\necosystem and developer support, time-to-market, reliable product roadmap execution, brand recognition, customer support and customization, and availability. The importance\nof these factors varies by product—for example, performance is a key competitive factor for data center platform products, and failure to introduce new products with\nperformance advantages can harm our competitive position and market segment share in our DCG business. For our memory products, price, density, and non-volatility are\namong the most important competitive factors. We will not realize our strategic goal to become the leading end-to-end provider for the new data world if our products do not meet\nour customers’ requirements across these factors in an increasingly competitive landscape.\nWe face intense competition across our product portfolio from companies offering platform products, such as AMD and Qualcomm; accelerator products such as GPUs, including\nthose offered by NVIDIA; other accelerator products such as ASICs, application-specific standard products, and FPGAs; memory and storage products; connectivity and\nnetworking products; and other semiconductor products. Some of these competitors have developed or utilize competing computing architectures and platforms for specific\nmarket segments or applications, such as the ARM* architecture, and these architectures and platforms can produce beneficial network effects for competitors when an\necosystem of customers and application developers for such architectures and platforms grows at scale. We also compete with internally developed semiconductors from OEMs,\ncloud service providers, and others, including customers. Some of these customers vertically integrate their own semiconductor designs with their software assets or customize\ntheir designs for specific computing workloads. Most of our competitors rely on third-party foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd. or Samsung\nElectronics Co., Ltd., and subcontractors for manufacture and assembly and test of their semiconductor components and products. As an IDM, we have higher capital\nexpenditures and R&D spending than many of our “fabless” competitors. We also face new sources of competition as a result of changes in industry participants through, for\nexample, acquisitions or business collaborations, as well as new entrants, including in China, which could have a significant impact on our competitive position.\nIntroduction of competitive new products and technologies, aggressive pricing, and other actions taken by competitors can harm demand for our products, exert downward\npricing pressure on our products, and adversely affect our business. Additionally, a number of business combinations and strategic partnerships in the semiconductor industry\nhave occurred over the last several years, and more could occur in the future. Consolidation could lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any of which could negatively\naffect our financial results.\nTo compete successfully, we must maintain a successful R&D effort, develop new products and production processes, and improve our existing products and processes, all\nahead of competitors. We are focusing our R&D efforts across six engineering pillars: process technology, architecture, memory, interconnect, security, and software. These\ninclude ambitious initiatives, such as our unified oneAPI portfolio of developer tools, and we cannot guarantee that all of these efforts will deliver the benefits we anticipate. For\nexample, to the extent we do not timely introduce new manufacturing process technologies that improve transistor density with sufficient manufacturing yields and operational\nefficiency, relative to competing foundry processes, we can face cost and product performance disadvantages. Similarly, to the extent our R&D efforts do not timely produce\nsemiconductor designs for our platform products with improvements in areas like performance, performance per watt, die utilization, and core counts, and with new features such\nas optimizations for AI and other workloads, our competitive position can be harmed.\nWe do not expect all of our R&D investments to be successful. Some of our efforts to develop and market new products fail, and the products and technologies we invest in and\ndevelop are not always well received by customers, who may adopt competing technologies. We make significant investments in R&D, and our investments at times do not\ncontribute to our future operating results for several years, if at all, and such contributions at times do not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments.\nIf we are not able to compete effectively, our financial results will be adversely affected, including reduced revenue and gross margin, and we may be required to accelerate the\nwrite-down of the value of certain assets.\nOTHER KEY INFORMATION 51\nTable of Contents\nOur investments in new businesses, products, and technologies are inherently risky and do not always succeed. In recent years, in connection with our strategic transformation\nto a data-centric company, we have entered new areas and introduced adjacent products in programmable solutions, AI, and autonomous driving. We also expanded our\nadjacent product offerings in client computing, the data center, the Internet of Things, and memory, with offerings such as modems, silicon photonics solutions, and Intel®\nOptane™ technology products, and we have made investments in discrete graphics and networking infrastructure products. These efforts are not always successful. In April\n2019, we announced that we would be exiting the 5G smartphone modem business based on our determination that there was no clear path to profitability for the business, and\nin November 2019, we completed the sale of the majority of our smartphone modem business.\nThese new and developing areas and products represent a significant portion of our expanded TAM, and they also introduce new sources of competition, including, in certain of\nthese market segments, incumbent competitors with established technologies and customer bases, lower prices or costs, and greater brand recognition. These developing\nproducts and market segments require significant investment, do not always grow as significantly as projected, or at all, or sometimes utilize technologies that are different from\nthe ones that we develop and manufacture, and we may not realize an adequate return on our investments. For example, AI and machine learning are increasingly driving\ninnovations in technology, but if they fail to deliver the benefits anticipated, or if our customers use competing technologies for these workloads, we may not realize a return on\nour investments in these areas. Similarly, while we see significant opportunity in networking infrastructure and the distribution of computing to the network edge, we expect\nintense competition for this opportunity and may not succeed in our efforts. To be successful, we need to cultivate new industry relationships with customers and partners in\nthese market segments. In addition, we must continually improve the cost, performance, integration, time-to-market, and energy efficiency of our products, as well as expand our\nsoftware capabilities to provide customers with comprehensive computing solutions. Some of these new businesses face challenging market conditions. For example, market\npricing for NAND memory products has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile, and NAND pricing pressure led to an operating loss for our NSG business in 2019. Despite\nour ongoing efforts, there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments or\nrealize an adequate return on our investments, which could lead to impairment of assets and restructuring charges.\nChanges in the mix of products sold can impact our financial results. Our pricing and margins vary across our products and market segments due in part to marketability of our\nproducts and differences in their features or manufacturing costs. For example, our platform product offerings range from lower-priced and entry-level platforms, such as those\nbased on Intel Atom® processors, to higher-end platforms based on Intel® Xeon® processors. Our adjacent products also typically have significantly lower margins than our\nhigher-priced platform products. To the extent demand shifts from our higher-priced to lower-priced platform products in any of our market segments, or our adjacent products\nrepresent an increasingly greater share of our mix of products sold, our gross margin percentage may decrease.\nWE OPERATE GLOBALLY AND ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS IN MANY JURISDICTIONS.\nGlobal or regional conditions can harm our financial results. We have manufacturing, assembly and test, R&D, sales, and other operations in many countries, and some of our\nbusiness activities are concentrated in one or more geographic areas. Moreover, sales outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 78% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 28, 2019, with revenue from billings to China, including Hong Kong, contributing approximately 28% of our total revenue. As a result, our operations and our financial\nresults, including our ability to manufacture, assemble and test, design, develop, or sell products, and the demand for our products, are at times adversely affected by a number\nof global and regional factors outside of our control.\nAdverse changes in global or regional economic conditions, including recession or slowing growth, changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy, higher interest\nrates, tighter credit, inflation, lower capital expenditures by businesses including on IT infrastructure, increases in unemployment, and lower consumer confidence and spending,\nperiodically occur and can significantly harm demand for our products and make it more challenging to forecast our operating results and make business decisions, including\nregarding prioritization of investments in our business. An economic downturn or increased uncertainty may also lead to increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing\ncosts or limits on our access to capital markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our suppliers, failures of counterparties and other financial institutions, and declines in the\nvalue of our financial instruments.\nInternational trade disputes at times result in increased tariffs, trade barriers, and other protectionist measures that can increase our manufacturing costs, make our products less\ncompetitive, reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to sell to certain customers, limit our ability to procure components or raw materials, or impede or slow the\nmovement of our goods across borders. Increasing protectionism and economic nationalism may lead to further changes in trade policy, domestic sourcing initiatives, or other\nformal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our products in, or restrict our access to, some markets.\nEscalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China have led to increased tariffs and trade restrictions, including tariffs applicable to some of our products, and have affected\ncustomer ordering patterns. The U.S. has imposed restrictions on the export of U.S.-regulated products and technology to certain Chinese technology companies, including\ncertain of our customers. These restrictions have reduced our sales, and continuing or future restrictions could adversely affect our financial results, result in reputational harm to\nus due to our relationship with such companies, or lead such companies to develop or adopt technologies that compete with our products. It is difficult to predict what further\ntrade-related actions governments may take, which may include additional or increased tariffs and trade restrictions, and we may be unable to quickly and effectively react to\nsuch actions. For example, U.S. legislation has expanded the power of the U.S. Department of Commerce to restrict the export of “emerging and foundational technologies” yet\nto be identified, which could impact our current or future products.\nOTHER KEY INFORMATION 52\nTable of Contents\nTrade disputes and protectionist measures, or continued uncertainty about such matters, could result in declining consumer confidence and slowing economic growth or\nrecession, and could cause our customers to reduce, cancel, or alter the timing of their purchases with us. Sustained trade tensions could lead to long-term changes in global\ntrade and technology supply chains, which could adversely affect our business and growth prospects.\nWe can be adversely affected by other global and regional factors that periodically occur, including:\n• geopolitical and security issues, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, political instability, human rights concerns, and terrorist activity, including, for example,\ngeopolitical tensions and conflict affecting Israel, where our Mobileye business headquarters and certain of our fabrication facilities are located;\n• natural disasters, public health issues, and other catastrophic events;\n• inefficient infrastructure and other disruptions, such as supply chain interruptions and large-scale outages or unreliable provision of services from utilities, transportation, data\nhosting, or telecommunications providers;\n• formal or informal imposition of new or revised export, import, or doing-business regulations, including trade sanctions, tariffs, and changes in the ability to obtain export\nlicenses, which could be changed without notice;\n• government restrictions on, or nationalization of, our operations in any country, or restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings from a particular country;\n• adverse changes relating to government grants, tax credits, or other government incentives;\n• differing employment practices and labor issues;\n• ineffective legal protection of our IP rights in certain countries;\n• local business and cultural factors that differ from our current standards and practices;\n• continuing uncertainty regarding social, political, immigration, and tax and trade policies in the U.S. and abroad, including as a result of the United Kingdom's vote to\nwithdraw from the European Union;\n• fluctuations in the market values of our domestic and international investments, which can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, interest rate\nchanges, financial results, political risk, sovereign risk, or other factors; and\n• uncertainty regarding LIBOR—certain of our interest rate derivatives and investments are based on LIBOR, and a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable\ninterest rates, primarily based on LIBOR: LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform, which may cause\nLIBOR to disappear entirely after 2021 or to perform differently than in the past, and while we expect that reasonable alternatives to LIBOR will be implemented prior to the\n2021 target date, we cannot predict the consequences and timing of these developments, and they could include an increase in our interest expense and/or a reduction in\nour interest income.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations worldwide that differ among jurisdictions, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to: IP ownership and infringement; tax;\nimport and export requirements; anti-corruption; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition; advertising; employment;\nproduct regulations; environment, health, and safety requirements; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, and may otherwise\nimpact our business operations negatively. For example, unfavorable developments with evolving laws and regulations worldwide related to 5G or autonomous driving technology\nmay limit global adoption, impede our strategy, and negatively impact our long-term expectations for our investments in these areas. Expanding privacy legislation and\ncompliance costs of privacy-related and data protection measures could adversely affect our customers and their products and services, particularly in cloud, Internet of Things,\nand AI applications, which could in turn reduce demand for our products used for those workloads.\nAlthough we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors,\nsuppliers, or agents will not violate such laws or our policies. Violations of these laws and regulations can result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our\nemployees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. The technology industry is subject to intense media, political, and regulatory scrutiny,\nwhich can increase our exposure to government investigations, legal actions, and penalties.\nWe are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We are exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency exchange rates. Although most of our sales\noccur in U.S. dollars, expenses may be paid in local currencies. An increase in the value of the dollar can increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those\nmarkets outside the U.S. where we sell in dollars, and a weakened dollar can increase the cost of expenses such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, as well as\noverseas capital expenditures. We also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies. Our hedging programs may not be effective to offset any, or more\nthan a portion, of the adverse impact of currency exchange rate movements; therefore, changes in exchange rates can harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nOTHER KEY INFORMATION 53\nTable of Contents\nCatastrophic events can have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. Our operations and business, and those of our customers and suppliers, can be\ndisrupted by natural disasters; industrial accidents; public health issues; cybersecurity incidents; interruptions of service from utilities, transportation, telecommunications, or IT\nsystems providers; manufacturing equipment failures; or other catastrophic events. For example, we have at times experienced disruptions in our manufacturing processes as a\nresult of power outages, improperly functioning equipment, and disruptions in supply of raw materials or components, including due to cybersecurity incidents affecting our\nsuppliers. Our headquarters and many of our operations and facilities are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change can result\nin certain natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise, and flooding, and could disrupt the availability of\nwater necessary for the operation of our fabrication facilities located in semi-arid regions. Catastrophic events could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver\nproducts to our customers, receive production materials from our suppliers, or perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery\ntime and expenditures to resume operations. While we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to enable us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can\nbe disruptive to our business, some of our systems are not fully redundant and we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disruptions. Furthermore, even\nif our operations are unaffected or recover quickly, if our customers cannot timely resume their own operations due to a catastrophic event, they may reduce or cancel their\norders, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks. The types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability,\ncost, and decisions with respect to risk retention. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions. In addition, one or more of our insurance providers may be\nunable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nDamage to our reputation can damage our business. Our reputation is a critical factor in our relationships with customers, employees, governments, suppliers, and other\nstakeholders. Our failure to address, or the appearance of our failure to address, issues that give rise to reputational risk, including those described throughout this Risk Factors\nsection, could significantly harm our reputation and our brands. Our reputation is also impacted by how we respond to corporate crises. Corporate crises can arise from\ncatastrophic events as well as from incidents involving unethical behavior or misconduct; product quality, security, or safety issues; allegations of legal noncompliance; internal\ncontrol failures; corporate governance issues; data breaches; workplace safety incidents; environmental incidents; the use of our products for illegal or objectionable applications;\nmarketing practices; media statements; the conduct of our suppliers or representatives; and other issues or incidents that, whether actual or perceived, result in adverse publicity.\nTo the extent we fail to respond quickly and effectively to address such crises, the ensuing negative public reaction could significantly harm our reputation and our brands and\ncould lead to increases in litigation claims and asserted damages or subject us to regulatory actions or restrictions.\nDamage to our reputation could reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business and operating environment. It could reduce investor confidence in us,\nadversely affecting our stock price. It may also limit our ability to be seen as an employer of choice when competing for highly skilled employees. Moreover, repairing our\nreputation and brands may be difficult, time-consuming, and expensive.\nWE ARE VULNERABLE TO PRODUCT AND MANUFACTURING-RELATED RISKS.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing process technology. Production of integrated circuits is a complex process.\nRealizing the economics of Moore’s Law is a strategic priority, and we are continually engaged in the development of next-generation process technologies at increasingly\nadvanced nodes. We are not always successful or efficient in developing or implementing new process nodes and production processes. For example, we experienced\nsignificant delays in implementing our 10nm process technology. Although we began shipping products based on our 10nm process technology in volume in 2019, our delays in\ntransitioning to this node occurred while third-party foundries developed new, competitive process technologies. Competitors using third-party foundries are able to benefit from\nthe improvements such process technologies made in performance, energy efficiency, and other features, which can help increase the competitiveness of their products.\nOur efforts to innovate involve significant expense and carry inherent risks, including difficulties in designing and developing next-generation process technologies, and\ninvestments in manufacturing assets and facilities that are made years in advance of the process node introduction. We cannot guarantee that we will realize the expected\nbenefits of next-generation process technologies, including the expected cost and density advantages, or that we will achieve an adequate return on our capital investments,\nparticularly as development of new nodes has grown increasingly expensive.\nRisks inherent in the development of next-generation process technologies include production timing delays, lower-than-anticipated manufacturing yields, longer manufacturing\nthroughput times, and product defects and errata. Production timing delays have at times caused us to miss customer product design windows, which can result in lost revenue\nopportunities and damage to our customer relationships. Furthermore, when the introduction of next-generation process nodes is delayed, including additional competitive\nfeatures in our products can result in larger die size products, manufacturing supply constraints, and increased product costs. Lower manufacturing yields and longer\nmanufacturing throughput times, compared to previous process nodes, can increase our product costs and adversely affect our gross margins, and can contribute to\nmanufacturing supply constraints. In addition, as the die size of our products has increased and our manufacturing process nodes have shrunk, our products and manufacturing\nprocesses have grown increasingly complex and more susceptible to product defects and errata, which can also contribute to production timing delays and lower yields.\nOTHER KEY INFORMATION 54\nTable of Contents\nFrom time to time, disruptions in the production process result from errors, defects in materials, delays in obtaining or revising operating permits and licenses, interruptions in our\nsupply of materials or resources, and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents, maintenance issues, or unsafe working conditions—all of\nwhich could affect the timing of production ramps and yields.\nProduction issues periodically lead to increased costs and affect our ability to meet product demand, which can adversely impact our business and the results of operations. In\naddition, to the extent we face delays in the timing of our product introductions, we could become less competitive and lose revenue opportunities, and our gross margin could be\nadversely affected because we incur significant costs up front in the product development stage and earn revenue to offset these costs over time.\nWe face supply chain risks. Thousands of suppliers provide materials and equipment that we use in production and other aspects of our business. Where possible, we seek to\nhave several sources of supply. However, for certain materials and equipment, including certain photolithography tools, we rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, or\nupon suppliers in a single location. In addition, supplier consolidation or business failures can impact the nature, quality, availability, and pricing of the products and services\navailable to us. The inability of suppliers to deliver necessary production materials or equipment can disrupt our production processes and make it more difficult for us to\nimplement our business strategy. Production can be disrupted by the unavailability of resources, such as water, silicon, electricity, gases, and other materials. The unavailability\nor reduced availability of materials or resources can require us to reduce production or incur additional costs, which could harm our business and results of operations. Our\nmanufacturing operations and ability to meet product demand may also be impacted by IP or other litigation between our suppliers, where an injunction against Intel or a supplier\ncould interrupt the availability of goods or services supplied to Intel by others.\nWe also rely on third-party providers to manufacture, assemble and test, and supply certain components or products. These have included components and products related to\nnetworking, communications, programmable semiconductor solutions, and memory, and may include these and other components and products in the future. To the extent any of\nthese third parties are unable to perform these services on a timely or cost-effective basis, in sufficient volumes, or at all, we can encounter supply delays or disruptions or incur\nadditional costs that could adversely affect our business and financial results. For example, while we have supply agreements providing for the supply of Intel® 3D XPoint™\nmemory from IMFT for a period following the close of Micron’s purchase of our interest in IMFT, we will need to fund and develop internal manufacturing options to continue 3D\nXPoint memory supply in the longer term.\nIn addition, increased regulation or stakeholder expectations regarding responsible sourcing practices could cause our compliance costs to increase or result in publicity that\nnegatively affects our reputation. Moreover, given that we use many materials in the manufacturing of our products and rely on many suppliers to provide these materials, but do\nnot directly control the procurement or employment practices of such suppliers, we could be subject to similar financial or reputational risks as a result of our suppliers' conduct.\nWe are subject to the risks of product defects, errata, or other product issues. From time to time, we identify product defects, errata (deviations from published specifications),\nand other product issues, which can result from problems in our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test processes. Components and products we purchase\nor license from third-party suppliers, or attain through acquisitions, can also contain defects. Product issues also sometimes result from the interaction between our products and\nthird-party products and software. We also face risks if products that we design, manufacture, or sell, or that include our technology, cause personal injury or property damage,\neven where the cause is unrelated to product defects or errata. These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, market segments, technologies, or\napplications, including transportation and autonomous driving, healthcare, communications, and financial services, and other industrial, critical infrastructure, and consumer uses.\nCosts from defects, errata, or other product issues could include:\n• writing off some or all of the value of inventory;\n• recalling products that have been shipped;\n• providing product replacements or modifications;\n• reimbursing customers for certain costs they incur;\n• defending against litigation and/or paying resulting damages; and\n• paying fines imposed by regulatory agencies.\nThese costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin, and result in delay or loss of revenue. Mitigation techniques designed to address product\nissues, including software and firmware updates, are not always available on a timely basis or at all, do not always operate as intended or effectively resolve such issues for all\napplications, and can result in adverse performance effects. Any product defects, errata, or other issues could damage our reputation, negatively affect product demand, delay\nproduct releases, or result in legal liability. Product defects or errata could cause customers to purchase products from competitors. Any of these occurrences could harm our\nbusiness and financial results. In addition, although we maintain liability insurance, our coverage has certain exclusions or may not adequately cover liabilities incurred. Our\ninsurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim, and losses not covered by insurance could be large, which could harm our financial condition.\nOTHER KEY INFORMATION 55\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to risks associated with environmental, health, and safety regulations. The manufacturing and assembly and test of our products require the use of hazardous\nmaterials that are subject to a broad array of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws or regulations can result in:\n• regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities;\n• suspension of production;\n• alteration of our manufacturing and assembly and test processes;\n• damage to our reputation; and\n• restrictions on our operations or sales.\nOur failure to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, or disposal of hazardous materials can lead to increased costs or future liabilities. Our\nability to expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future may be impeded by environmental regulations, such as air quality and wastewater requirements.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations sometimes require us to acquire additional pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product designs, or incur other expenses.\nRegulations in response to climate change could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution requirements, and increased compliance and energy costs.\nMany new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations are subject to regulation under environmental laws and regulations. These restrictions could harm our\nbusiness and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processes.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY RISKS.\nWe face risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents. We regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet, or to introduce malicious\nsoftware, to our IT systems. Additionally, individuals or organizations, including malicious hackers, state-sponsored organizations, insider threats including employees and thirdparty service providers, or intruders into our physical facilities, at times attempt to gain unauthorized access and corrupt the processes used to design and manufacture our\nhardware products and our associated software and services. Due to the widespread use of our products, we are a frequent target of computer hackers and organizations that\nintend to sabotage, take control of, or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other processes, products, and services. We are also a target of malicious attackers who attempt to\ngain access to our network or data centers or those of our customers or end users; steal proprietary information related to our business, products, employees, and customers;\ninterrupt our systems and services or those of our customers or others; or demand ransom to return control of such systems and services. Such attempts are increasing in\nnumber and in technical sophistication, and if successful, expose us and the affected parties to risk of loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information or disruptions of\nour business operations, including our manufacturing operations. Our IT infrastructure also includes products and services provided by third parties, and these providers can\nexperience breaches of their systems and products that impact the security of our systems and our proprietary or confidential information.\nFrom time to time, we encounter intrusions or unauthorized access to our network, products, services, or infrastructure. To date, none have resulted in any material adverse\nimpact to our business or operations. Such incidents, whether or not successful, could result in our incurring significant costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems,\nwriting down inventory value, implementing additional threat protection measures, providing modifications to our products and services, defending against litigation, responding to\nregulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, providing customers with incentives to maintain the business relationship, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third\nparties, as well as reputational harm. In addition, these threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing\nadequate preventative measures. While we seek to detect and investigate all unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network, products, and services, and to prevent their\nrecurrence where practicable through changes to our internal processes and tools and changes or updates to our products and services, we remain potentially vulnerable to\nadditional known or unknown threats. In some instances, we, our customers, and the users of our products and services can be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and\neffects.\nWe face risks related to security vulnerabilities in our products. We or third parties regularly identify security vulnerabilities with respect to our processors and other products, as\nwell as the operating systems and workloads that run on them. Components and IP we purchase or license from third parties for use in our products, as well as industry-standard\nspecifications we implement in our products, are also regularly subject to security vulnerabilities. As we have become a more data-centric company, our processors and other\nproducts are being used in additional and new critical application areas that create new or increased cybersecurity and privacy risks, including applications that gather and\nprocess large amounts of data, such as the cloud or Internet of Things, and critical infrastructure and automotive applications. The security vulnerabilities identified in our\nprocessors include a category known as side-channel exploits, such as the variants referred to as “Spectre” and “Meltdown.” Additional categories and variants have been\nidentified, such as the \"MDS\" and \"TAA\" side channel variants, and are expected to continue to be identified. Publicity about these and other security vulnerabilities has resulted\nin, and is expected to continue to result in, increased attempts by third parties to identify additional vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are not always mitigated before they become\nknown. We, our customers, and the users of our products do not always promptly learn of or have the ability to fully assess the magnitude or effects of a vulnerability, including\nthe extent, if any, to which a vulnerability has been exploited. Subsequent events or new information can develop that changes our assessment of the impact of a security\nvulnerability, including additional information learned as we develop and deploy mitigations or updates, become aware of additional variants, evaluate the competitiveness of\nexisting and new products, and address future warranty or other claims or customer satisfaction considerations, as well as developments in the course of any litigation or\nregulatory inquiries or actions over these matters.\nOTHER KEY INFORMATION 56\nTable of Contents\nMitigation techniques designed to address security vulnerabilities, including software and firmware updates or other preventative measures, are not always available on a timely\nbasis—or at all—and at times do not operate as intended or effectively resolve vulnerabilities for all applications. In addition, we are often required to rely on third parties,\nincluding hardware, software, and services vendors, as well as our customers and end users, to develop and/or deploy mitigation techniques, and the availability, effectiveness,\nand performance impact of mitigation techniques can depend solely or in part on the actions of these third parties in determining whether and how to develop and deploy\nmitigations. We and such third parties may make prioritization decisions about which vulnerabilities to address, which can delay or limit development or deployment of a\nmitigation and harm our reputation. Security vulnerabilities and/or mitigation techniques can result in adverse performance effects, reboots, system instability or unavailability,\nloss of functionality, data loss or corruption, unpredictable system behavior, decisions by customers and end users to limit or change the applications in which they use our\nproducts or product features, and/or the misappropriation of data by third parties.\nSecurity vulnerabilities and any limitations of, or adverse effects resulting from, mitigation techniques can adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, customer\nrelationships, prospects, and reputation in a number of ways, any of which may be material. For example, whether or not they involve attempted or successful exploits, they may\nresult in our incurring significant costs related to developing and deploying updates and mitigations, writing down inventory value, defending against product claims and litigation,\nresponding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, addressing customer satisfaction considerations, providing product replacements or modifications, or taking other\nremedial steps with respect to third parties. Adverse publicity about security vulnerabilities or mitigations could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce\ndemand for our products and services. These effects may be greater to the extent that competing products are not susceptible to the same vulnerabilities or if vulnerabilities can\nbe more effectively mitigated in competing products. Moreover, third parties can release information regarding potential vulnerabilities of our products before mitigations are\navailable, which, in turn, could lead to attempted or successful exploits, adversely affect our ability to introduce mitigations, or otherwise harm our business and reputation. For\nexample, information on the “Spectre” and “Meltdown” side-channel variants was prematurely reported publicly before mitigation techniques to address all vulnerabilities were\nmade widely available, and certain of the mitigation techniques did not operate as intended.\nTheft, loss, or misuse of personal data about our employees, customers, or other third parties could increase our expenses, damage our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory\nproceedings. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased business and\nsecurity costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex\nregulatory compliance environment. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant, and noncompliance could\nexpose us to significant monetary penalties, damage to our reputation, suspension of online services or sites in certain countries, and even criminal sanctions. Even our\ninadvertent failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related or data-protection laws and regulations could result in audits, regulatory inquiries, or proceedings\nagainst us by governmental entities or other third parties.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO IP RISKS AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS.\nWe cannot always enforce or protect our IP rights. We regard our patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and other IP rights as important to the success of our business. We rely on\nIP law—as well as confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers, employees, technology development partners, and others—to protect our IP rights. Our ability to\nenforce these rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our IP rights in various countries. We are not always able to enforce or\nprotect our IP rights. Enforcement is costly and time-consuming and can divert management attention. When we seek to enforce our rights, we may be subject to claims that our\nIP rights are invalid, not enforceable, or licensed to an opposing party. Our assertion of IP rights may result in another party seeking to assert claims against us, which could\nharm our business. From time to time, governments adopt regulations—and governments or courts render decisions—requiring compulsory licensing of IP rights, or governments\nrequire products to meet standards that favor local companies. Our inability to enforce our IP rights under any of these circumstances can harm our competitive position and\nbusiness. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce\nacceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in R&D, product development, and marketing could be reduced. This risk is heightened as competitors for\ntechnical talent increasingly seek to hire our employees.\nOur licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives at times allow competitors to use some of our patent rights. Technology companies often bilaterally\nlicense patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements. Some of our competitors have in the past had, and may in the future have, licenses to\nsome of our patents, and under current case law, some of the licenses can exhaust our patent rights as to licensed product sales under some circumstances. Our participation in\nindustry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives at times requires us to offer to license our patents to companies that adopt industry-standard specifications.\nDepending on the rules of the organization, government regulations, or court decisions, we sometimes have to grant licenses to some of our patents for little or no cost, and as a\nresult, we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others, and the value of our IP rights may be impaired.\nOTHER KEY INFORMATION 57\nTable of Contents\nThird parties assert claims based on IP rights against us and our products, which could harm our business. We face claims based on IP rights from individuals and companies,\nincluding claims from those who have aggregated patents acquired from multiple sources to form a new, larger portfolio to assert claims against us and other companies. Some\nof these claimants are funded by investment firms and have substantial resources, which can increase our defense costs. Additionally, large patent portfolio owners sometimes\ndivest portions of their portfolios to more than one individual or company, increasing the number of parties who own IP rights previously all held by a single party. We are typically\nengaged in a number of disputes involving IP rights. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of their merits, cause us to incur large costs\nto respond to, defend, and resolve the claims, and they divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business and operations. In addition,\nwe may face claims based on the alleged theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets or confidential information or end-user data that we obtain in\nconducting our business. Any such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business, and we could suffer losses, including the cost of product recalls and returns, and\nreputational harm. Furthermore, we have agreed to indemnify customers for certain IP rights claims against them. IP rights claims against our customers could also limit demand\nfor our products or disrupt our customers’ businesses, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs a result of IP rights claims, we could:\n• pay monetary damages, including payments to satisfy indemnification obligations, or royalties;\n• stop manufacturing, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products or technology subject to claims;\n• need to develop other products or technology not subject to claims, which could be time-consuming or costly; and/or\n• enter into settlement or license agreements, which agreements may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nThese IP rights claims could harm our competitive position, result in expenses, or require us to impair our assets. If we alter or stop production of affected items, our revenue\ncould be harmed.\nWe rely on access to third-party IP, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Many of our products include third-party technology or\nimplement industry standards, and may require licenses from third parties. Based on past experience and industry practice, we believe such licenses generally can be obtained\non commercially reasonable terms. However, there is no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use\nthird-party technology, or to license IP on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude us from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our\nfinancial condition and operating results. To the extent our products include software that contains or is derived from open-source software, we may be required to make the\nsoftware’s source code publicly available and/or license the software under open-source licensing terms.\nWe are subject to risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings. From time to time, we face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer,\ncompetition, commercial, IP, and other issues on a global basis. As described in \"Note 20: Commitments and Contingencies\" within the Consolidated Financial Statements, we\nare engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary\ndamages, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory\nlicensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome can result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, regardless of the\noutcome, litigation and regulatory proceedings can be costly, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations, and distracting to management.\nWE MUST ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE KEY EMPLOYEES.\nHiring and retaining qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff, and sales representatives are critical to our business, and competition for highly skilled employees\nin our industry is intense. In addition, changes in immigration policies may impair our ability to recruit and hire technical and professional talent. Changes in the interpretation and\napplication of employment-related laws to our workforce practices may also result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our changing workforce needs.\nTo help attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, we use share-based awards, such as RSUs, and performance-based cash incentive awards. Our employee hiring and\nretention also depend on our ability to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive workplace culture and be viewed as an employer of choice. If our share-based or other\ncompensation programs and workplace culture cease to be viewed as competitive, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees would be weakened, which could harm\nour results of operations. Furthermore, changes in our management team can disrupt our business, and the failure to successfully transition and assimilate key employees could\nadversely affect our results of operations.\nOTHER KEY INFORMATION 58\nTable of Contents\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS.\nOur acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic transactions could fail to achieve our financial or strategic objectives, disrupt our ongoing business, and adversely impact our\nresults of operations. Strategic transactions are an important component of our financial capital allocation strategy. We routinely evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements\nfor possible acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic transactions. These transactions involve numerous risks, including:\n• our inability to identify opportunities in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us;\n• failure of the transaction to advance our business strategy and of its anticipated benefits to materialize;\n• disruption of our ongoing operations and diversion of our management’s attention;\n• failure to complete a transaction in a timely manner, if at all, due to our inability to obtain required government or other approvals at all or without materially burdensome\nconditions, IP disputes or other litigation, difficulty in obtaining financing on terms acceptable to us, or other unforeseen factors;\n• our failure to realize a satisfactory return on our investment, potentially resulting in an impairment of goodwill and other assets, and restructuring charges;\n• our inability to effectively enter new market segments through our strategic transactions or retain customers and partners of acquired businesses;\n• our inability to retain key personnel of acquired businesses or our difficulty in integrating employees, business systems, and technology;\n• controls, processes, and procedures of acquired businesses that do not adequately ensure compliance with laws and regulations, and our failure to identify compliance\nissues or liabilities;\n• our failure to identify, or our underestimation of, commitments, liabilities, and other risks associated with acquired businesses or assets; and\n• the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or significant additional debt.\nMoreover, our resources are limited and our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we at times need to forgo\nthe prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our financial or strategic objectives. Where an existing investment does not meet our criteria for\nsuccess, we routinely evaluate opportunities for possible divestitures and other options. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of divestitures due to risks that include\nunfavorable prices and terms; changes in market conditions; limitations due to regulatory or governmental approvals, contractual terms, or other conditions; and continued\nfinancial obligations or unanticipated liabilities associated with such transactions. In some cases, we are not able to divest investments on acceptable terms or at all.\nAny of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, particularly in the case of a large acquisition or\nseveral concurrent acquisitions.\nWe invest in public and private companies and do not always realize a return on our investments. We make investments in public and private companies around the world to\nfurther our strategic and financial objectives and to support certain key business initiatives. Companies in which we invest range from early-stage companies still defining their\nstrategic direction to mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable and illiquid at\nthe time of our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return in a timely fashion, if at all. Our ability to realize a return on our investment in a private company,\nif any, is typically dependent on the company participating in a liquidity event, such as a public offering or acquisition. To the extent our investments are in marketable equity\nsecurities, as is typically the case for our public company investments, fluctuations in the fair value of those securities are recognized as gains or losses in our income statement,\nand consequently, declines in the fair value of these investments can reduce our net income. To the extent any of the companies in which we invest are not successful, which can\ninclude failures to achieve business objectives as well as bankruptcy, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO SALES-RELATED RISKS.\nWe face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties. We sell a significant portion of our products through third parties such as distributors, value-added\nresellers, and channel partners (collectively referred to as distributors), as well as OEMs and ODMs. We depend on many distributors to help us create end-customer demand,\nprovide technical support and other value-added services to customers, fill customer orders, and stock our products. At times, we rely on one or more key distributors for a\nproduct, and a material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors or their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue. Our ability to add or\nreplace distributors for some of our products is limited. In addition, our distributors' expertise in the determination and stocking of acceptable inventory levels for some of our\nproducts is not always easily transferable to a new distributor; as a result, end customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a distributor. Using third\nparties for distribution exposes us to many risks, including competitive pressure and concentration, credit, and compliance risks. Distributors and other third parties sell products\nthat compete with our products, and we sometimes need to provide financial and other incentives to focus them on the sale of our products. From time to time, they face financial\ndifficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws by\ndistributors or other third-party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business. Failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors and other third parties may\nreduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position.\nOTHER KEY INFORMATION 59\nTable of Contents\nFrom time to time, our products are resold by third parties in an unauthorized “gray market.” Gray market products can distort demand and pricing dynamics in our distribution\nchannel and certain geographies, which could adversely affect our revenue opportunities. Gray market activity is difficult to monitor and can make forecasting demand more\nchallenging. Gray market products also sometimes include parts that have been altered or damaged, and our reputation may be harmed when these products fail or are found to\nbe substandard.\nWe receive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers. Collectively, our three largest customers accounted for approximately 41% of our net revenue\nin 2019 and 39% of our net revenue in 2018. We expect a small number of customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future.\nIndustry trends, such as the increasing shift of data center workloads to the public cloud, have increased the significance of certain customers, particularly cloud service\nproviders, to some of our data-centric businesses. The cloud and cloud applications represent a new and increasingly demanding computing environment. The further\nconsolidation of computing workloads in the cloud, and consolidation among cloud service providers, can heighten the competitive importance of factors such as collaboration\nand customization with cloud service provider customers to optimize products for their environments; product performance; energy efficiency; feature differentiation; product\nquality, reliability, and factors affecting server uptime; and product security and security features. To the extent we do not execute effectively across these factors, our competitive\nposition and market segment share may be adversely affected. Some cloud service provider customers have also internally developed, and may continue to develop, their own\nsemiconductors, including designs customized for their specific computing workloads. The shift of data center workloads to the cloud has also adversely affected, and may\ncontinue to affect, sales to enterprise and government market segment customers when end users have elected to migrate workloads. To the extent we differentiate our products\nthrough customization to meet customer specifications, order changes, delays, or cancellations may result in non-recoverable costs.\nIf one of our key customers stops purchasing from us, materially reduces its demand for our products, or delays its orders for our products, we may experience a reduction in\nrevenue, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition. For more information about our customers, including customers who accounted for greater than 10%\nof our net consolidated revenue, see \"Note 4: Operating Segments\" within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe face risks related to transactions with government entities. We receive proceeds from U.S. federal, state, local and foreign government entities associated with grants,\nincentives, and sales of our products and services. Government demand and payment are often affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, including,\nwith respect to U.S. government contracts, congressional approval of appropriations. Government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations relating to the\naward, administration and performance of those contracts, as well as oversight and penalties for violations. For example, U.S. government contracts are subject to special rules\non accounting, IP rights, expenses, reviews, information handling, and security, and failure to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions,\nincluding termination of contracts, fines, and suspension or debarment from future business with the U.S. government.\nCHANGES IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE MAY REDUCE OUR NET INCOME.\nA number of factors can increase our effective tax rates, which could reduce our net income, including:\n• changes in the volume and mix of profits earned across jurisdictions with varying tax rates;\n• the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, including payment of interest and penalties;\n• changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances;\n• adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns;\n• increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill;\n• changes in available tax credits;\n• changes in our ability to secure new, or renew existing, tax holidays and incentives;\n• changes in U.S. federal, state, or foreign tax laws or their interpretation, including changes in the U.S. to the taxation of manufacturing enterprises and of non-U.S. income\nand expenses and changes resulting from the adoption by countries of OECD recommendations or other legislative actions;\n• changes in accounting standards; and\n• our decision to repatriate non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for local country withholding taxes incurred upon repatriation.\nWE HAVE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE AMOUNT AND FREQUENCY OF OUR STOCK REPURCHASES.\nWe are not obligated to make repurchases under our stock repurchase program, and the amount, timing, and execution of our repurchases fluctuate based on our priorities for\nthe use of cash for other purposes—such as investing in our business, including operational spending, capital spending, and acquisitions, and returning cash to our stockholders\nas dividend payments. Changes in cash flows, tax laws and other laws, and the market price of our common stock can also limit or alter the amount and frequency of our stock\nrepurchases.",

These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to\nbe immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and\nhistorical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Refer also to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including in\nMD&A and our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes.\nCHANGES IN PRODUCT DEMAND CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.\nDemand for our products is variable and hard to predict. Our products are used in different market segments, and demand for our products varies within or among the market\nsegments served by our PC-centric and data-centric businesses. It is difficult to forecast these changes and their impact. For example, in the first half of 2019, customers of our\nDCG business worked through inventory and absorbed computing capacity purchased in 2018, leading to a year over year decline in DCG platform revenue in the first half,\nfollowed by growth in DCG platform demand and revenue in the second half of 2019. Changes in the demand for our products, particularly our CCG and DCG platform products,\ncan reduce our revenue, lower our gross margin, or require us to write down the value of our assets.\nImportant factors that lead to variation in the demand for our products include:\n• business conditions, including downturns in the market segments in which we operate, or in the global or regional economies;\n• consumer confidence or income levels, and the levels of customer capital spending, which may be impacted by changes in market conditions, including changes in\ngovernment borrowing, taxation, or spending policies; the credit market; or expected inflation, employment, and energy or other commodity prices;\n• our ability to timely introduce competitive products;\n• competitive and pricing pressures, including new product introductions and other actions taken by competitors;\n• the level of our customers’ inventories and computing capacity;\n• customer order patterns, including order cancellations, which can be affected by maturing product cycles for our products, customers’ products, and related products such as\noperating system upgrade cycles; disruptions affecting customers; and other factors;\n• market acceptance and industry support of our new and maturing products, including the introduction and availability of products used together with our products; and\n• customer product needs and emerging technology trends, including changes in the levels and nature of customer and end-user computing workloads.\nOTHER KEY INFORMATION 50\nTable of Contents\nDue to the complexity of our manufacturing operations, we are not always able to timely respond to fluctuations in demand and we may incur significant charges and costs.\nBecause we own and operate high-tech fabrication facilities, our operations have high costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term, including our costs related to\nutilization of existing facilities, facility construction and equipment, R&D, and the employment and training of a highly skilled workforce. To the extent product demand decreases\nor we fail to forecast demand accurately, we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges, which would lower our gross margin. To the extent the\ndemand decrease is prolonged, our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which\nwould increase our expenses. We may also be required to shorten the useful lives of under-used facilities and equipment and accelerate depreciation. Conversely, to the extent\nproduct demand increases or we fail to forecast accurately and produce the mix of products demanded, we may be unable to add capacity or increase production fast enough to\nmeet market demand, which can result in a loss of revenue opportunities or market share, legal claims, and/or damage to customer relationships. For example, we have been\nexperiencing supply constraints and have been prioritizing production of our server and high-performance PC products, which during 2019 contributed to loss of share in the\nvalue end of the PC market, where we were short of supply while demand remained healthy.\nWe face significant competition. The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market developments; changes in industry\nstandards; changes in customer and end-user needs, expectations, and preferences; and frequent product introductions and improvements. If we do not anticipate and respond\nto these developments, our competitive position can weaken, and our products or technologies can become uncompetitive or obsolete. Our competitive environment has\nintensified, and we expect it to continue to do so in the future.\nOur products primarily compete based on performance, energy efficiency, integration, ease-of-use, innovative design, features, price, quality, reliability, security, software\necosystem and developer support, time-to-market, reliable product roadmap execution, brand recognition, customer support and customization, and availability. The importance\nof these factors varies by product—for example, performance is a key competitive factor for data center platform products, and failure to introduce new products with\nperformance advantages can harm our competitive position and market segment share in our DCG business. For our memory products, price, density, and non-volatility are\namong the most important competitive factors. We will not realize our strategic goal to become the leading end-to-end provider for the new data world if our products do not meet\nour customers’ requirements across these factors in an increasingly competitive landscape.\nWe face intense competition across our product portfolio from companies offering platform products, such as AMD and Qualcomm; accelerator products such as GPUs, including\nthose offered by NVIDIA; other accelerator products such as ASICs, application-specific standard products, and FPGAs; memory and storage products; connectivity and\nnetworking products; and other semiconductor products. Some of these competitors have developed or utilize competing computing architectures and platforms for specific\nmarket segments or applications, such as the ARM* architecture, and these architectures and platforms can produce beneficial network effects for competitors when an\necosystem of customers and application developers for such architectures and platforms grows at scale. We also compete with internally developed semiconductors from OEMs,\ncloud service providers, and others, including customers. Some of these customers vertically integrate their own semiconductor designs with their software assets or customize\ntheir designs for specific computing workloads. Most of our competitors rely on third-party foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd. or Samsung\nElectronics Co., Ltd., and subcontractors for manufacture and assembly and test of their semiconductor components and products. As an IDM, we have higher capital\nexpenditures and R&D spending than many of our “fabless” competitors. We also face new sources of competition as a result of changes in industry participants through, for\nexample, acquisitions or business collaborations, as well as new entrants, including in China, which could have a significant impact on our competitive position.\nIntroduction of competitive new products and technologies, aggressive pricing, and other actions taken by competitors can harm demand for our products, exert downward\npricing pressure on our products, and adversely affect our business. Additionally, a number of business combinations and strategic partnerships in the semiconductor industry\nhave occurred over the last several years, and more could occur in the future. Consolidation could lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any of which could negatively\naffect our financial results.\nTo compete successfully, we must maintain a successful R&D effort, develop new products and production processes, and improve our existing products and processes, all\nahead of competitors. We are focusing our R&D efforts across six engineering pillars: process technology, architecture, memory, interconnect, security, and software. These\ninclude ambitious initiatives, such as our unified oneAPI portfolio of developer tools, and we cannot guarantee that all of these efforts will deliver the benefits we anticipate. For\nexample, to the extent we do not timely introduce new manufacturing process technologies that improve transistor density with sufficient manufacturing yields and operational\nefficiency, relative to competing foundry processes, we can face cost and product performance disadvantages. Similarly, to the extent our R&D efforts do not timely produce\nsemiconductor designs for our platform products with improvements in areas like performance, performance per watt, die utilization, and core counts, and with new features such\nas optimizations for AI and other workloads, our competitive position can be harmed.\nWe do not expect all of our R&D investments to be successful. Some of our efforts to develop and market new products fail, and the products and technologies we invest in and\ndevelop are not always well received by customers, who may adopt competing technologies. We make significant investments in R&D, and our investments at times do not\ncontribute to our future operating results for several years, if at all, and such contributions at times do not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments.\nIf we are not able to compete effectively, our financial results will be adversely affected, including reduced revenue and gross margin, and we may be required to accelerate the\nwrite-down of the value of certain assets.\nOTHER KEY INFORMATION 51\nTable of Contents\nOur investments in new businesses, products, and technologies are inherently risky and do not always succeed. In recent years, in connection with our strategic transformation\nto a data-centric company, we have entered new areas and introduced adjacent products in programmable solutions, AI, and autonomous driving. We also expanded our\nadjacent product offerings in client computing, the data center, the Internet of Things, and memory, with offerings such as modems, silicon photonics solutions, and Intel®\nOptane™ technology products, and we have made investments in discrete graphics and networking infrastructure products. These efforts are not always successful. In April\n2019, we announced that we would be exiting the 5G smartphone modem business based on our determination that there was no clear path to profitability for the business, and\nin November 2019, we completed the sale of the majority of our smartphone modem business.\nThese new and developing areas and products represent a significant portion of our expanded TAM, and they also introduce new sources of competition, including, in certain of\nthese market segments, incumbent competitors with established technologies and customer bases, lower prices or costs, and greater brand recognition. These developing\nproducts and market segments require significant investment, do not always grow as significantly as projected, or at all, or sometimes utilize technologies that are different from\nthe ones that we develop and manufacture, and we may not realize an adequate return on our investments. For example, AI and machine learning are increasingly driving\ninnovations in technology, but if they fail to deliver the benefits anticipated, or if our customers use competing technologies for these workloads, we may not realize a return on\nour investments in these areas. Similarly, while we see significant opportunity in networking infrastructure and the distribution of computing to the network edge, we expect\nintense competition for this opportunity and may not succeed in our efforts. To be successful, we need to cultivate new industry relationships with customers and partners in\nthese market segments. In addition, we must continually improve the cost, performance, integration, time-to-market, and energy efficiency of our products, as well as expand our\nsoftware capabilities to provide customers with comprehensive computing solutions. Some of these new businesses face challenging market conditions. For example, market\npricing for NAND memory products has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile, and NAND pricing pressure led to an operating loss for our NSG business in 2019. Despite\nour ongoing efforts, there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments or\nrealize an adequate return on our investments, which could lead to impairment of assets and restructuring charges.\nChanges in the mix of products sold can impact our financial results. Our pricing and margins vary across our products and market segments due in part to marketability of our\nproducts and differences in their features or manufacturing costs. For example, our platform product offerings range from lower-priced and entry-level platforms, such as those\nbased on Intel Atom® processors, to higher-end platforms based on Intel® Xeon® processors. Our adjacent products also typically have significantly lower margins than our\nhigher-priced platform products. To the extent demand shifts from our higher-priced to lower-priced platform products in any of our market segments, or our adjacent products\nrepresent an increasingly greater share of our mix of products sold, our gross margin percentage may decrease.\nWE OPERATE GLOBALLY AND ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS IN MANY JURISDICTIONS.\nGlobal or regional conditions can harm our financial results. We have manufacturing, assembly and test, R&D, sales, and other operations in many countries, and some of our\nbusiness activities are concentrated in one or more geographic areas. Moreover, sales outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 78% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 28, 2019, with revenue from billings to China, including Hong Kong, contributing approximately 28% of our total revenue. As a result, our operations and our financial\nresults, including our ability to manufacture, assemble and test, design, develop, or sell products, and the demand for our products, are at times adversely affected by a number\nof global and regional factors outside of our control.\nAdverse changes in global or regional economic conditions, including recession or slowing growth, changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy, higher interest\nrates, tighter credit, inflation, lower capital expenditures by businesses including on IT infrastructure, increases in unemployment, and lower consumer confidence and spending,\nperiodically occur and can significantly harm demand for our products and make it more challenging to forecast our operating results and make business decisions, including\nregarding prioritization of investments in our business. An economic downturn or increased uncertainty may also lead to increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing\ncosts or limits on our access to capital markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our suppliers, failures of counterparties and other financial institutions, and declines in the\nvalue of our financial instruments.\nInternational trade disputes at times result in increased tariffs, trade barriers, and other protectionist measures that can increase our manufacturing costs, make our products less\ncompetitive, reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to sell to certain customers, limit our ability to procure components or raw materials, or impede or slow the\nmovement of our goods across borders. Increasing protectionism and economic nationalism may lead to further changes in trade policy, domestic sourcing initiatives, or other\nformal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our products in, or restrict our access to, some markets.\nEscalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China have led to increased tariffs and trade restrictions, including tariffs applicable to some of our products, and have affected\ncustomer ordering patterns. The U.S. has imposed restrictions on the export of U.S.-regulated products and technology to certain Chinese technology companies, including\ncertain of our customers. These restrictions have reduced our sales, and continuing or future restrictions could adversely affect our financial results, result in reputational harm to\nus due to our relationship with such companies, or lead such companies to develop or adopt technologies that compete with our products. It is difficult to predict what further\ntrade-related actions governments may take, which may include additional or increased tariffs and trade restrictions, and we may be unable to quickly and effectively react to\nsuch actions. For example, U.S. legislation has expanded the power of the U.S. Department of Commerce to restrict the export of “emerging and foundational technologies” yet\nto be identified, which could impact our current or future products.\nOTHER KEY INFORMATION 52\nTable of Contents\nTrade disputes and protectionist measures, or continued uncertainty about such matters, could result in declining consumer confidence and slowing economic growth or\nrecession, and could cause our customers to reduce, cancel, or alter the timing of their purchases with us. Sustained trade tensions could lead to long-term changes in global\ntrade and technology supply chains, which could adversely affect our business and growth prospects.\nWe can be adversely affected by other global and regional factors that periodically occur, including:\n• geopolitical and security issues, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, political instability, human rights concerns, and terrorist activity, including, for example,\ngeopolitical tensions and conflict affecting Israel, where our Mobileye business headquarters and certain of our fabrication facilities are located;\n• natural disasters, public health issues, and other catastrophic events;\n• inefficient infrastructure and other disruptions, such as supply chain interruptions and large-scale outages or unreliable provision of services from utilities, transportation, data\nhosting, or telecommunications providers;\n• formal or informal imposition of new or revised export, import, or doing-business regulations, including trade sanctions, tariffs, and changes in the ability to obtain export\nlicenses, which could be changed without notice;\n• government restrictions on, or nationalization of, our operations in any country, or restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings from a particular country;\n• adverse changes relating to government grants, tax credits, or other government incentives;\n• differing employment practices and labor issues;\n• ineffective legal protection of our IP rights in certain countries;\n• local business and cultural factors that differ from our current standards and practices;\n• continuing uncertainty regarding social, political, immigration, and tax and trade policies in the U.S. and abroad, including as a result of the United Kingdom's vote to\nwithdraw from the European Union;\n• fluctuations in the market values of our domestic and international investments, which can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, interest rate\nchanges, financial results, political risk, sovereign risk, or other factors; and\n• uncertainty regarding LIBOR—certain of our interest rate derivatives and investments are based on LIBOR, and a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable\ninterest rates, primarily based on LIBOR: LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform, which may cause\nLIBOR to disappear entirely after 2021 or to perform differently than in the past, and while we expect that reasonable alternatives to LIBOR will be implemented prior to the\n2021 target date, we cannot predict the consequences and timing of these developments, and they could include an increase in our interest expense and/or a reduction in\nour interest income.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations worldwide that differ among jurisdictions, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to: IP ownership and infringement; tax;\nimport and export requirements; anti-corruption; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition; advertising; employment;\nproduct regulations; environment, health, and safety requirements; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, and may otherwise\nimpact our business operations negatively. For example, unfavorable developments with evolving laws and regulations worldwide related to 5G or autonomous driving technology\nmay limit global adoption, impede our strategy, and negatively impact our long-term expectations for our investments in these areas. Expanding privacy legislation and\ncompliance costs of privacy-related and data protection measures could adversely affect our customers and their products and services, particularly in cloud, Internet of Things,\nand AI applications, which could in turn reduce demand for our products used for those workloads.\nAlthough we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors,\nsuppliers, or agents will not violate such laws or our policies. Violations of these laws and regulations can result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our\nemployees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. The technology industry is subject to intense media, political, and regulatory scrutiny,\nwhich can increase our exposure to government investigations, legal actions, and penalties.\nWe are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We are exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency exchange rates. Although most of our sales\noccur in U.S. dollars, expenses may be paid in local currencies. An increase in the value of the dollar can increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those\nmarkets outside the U.S. where we sell in dollars, and a weakened dollar can increase the cost of expenses such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, as well as\noverseas capital expenditures. We also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies. Our hedging programs may not be effective to offset any, or more\nthan a portion, of the adverse impact of currency exchange rate movements; therefore, changes in exchange rates can harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nOTHER KEY INFORMATION 53\nTable of Contents\nCatastrophic events can have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. Our operations and business, and those of our customers and suppliers, can be\ndisrupted by natural disasters; industrial accidents; public health issues; cybersecurity incidents; interruptions of service from utilities, transportation, telecommunications, or IT\nsystems providers; manufacturing equipment failures; or other catastrophic events. For example, we have at times experienced disruptions in our manufacturing processes as a\nresult of power outages, improperly functioning equipment, and disruptions in supply of raw materials or components, including due to cybersecurity incidents affecting our\nsuppliers. Our headquarters and many of our operations and facilities are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change can result\nin certain natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise, and flooding, and could disrupt the availability of\nwater necessary for the operation of our fabrication facilities located in semi-arid regions. Catastrophic events could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver\nproducts to our customers, receive production materials from our suppliers, or perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery\ntime and expenditures to resume operations. While we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to enable us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can\nbe disruptive to our business, some of our systems are not fully redundant and we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disruptions. Furthermore, even\nif our operations are unaffected or recover quickly, if our customers cannot timely resume their own operations due to a catastrophic event, they may reduce or cancel their\norders, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks. The types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability,\ncost, and decisions with respect to risk retention. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions. In addition, one or more of our insurance providers may be\nunable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nDamage to our reputation can damage our business. Our reputation is a critical factor in our relationships with customers, employees, governments, suppliers, and other\nstakeholders. Our failure to address, or the appearance of our failure to address, issues that give rise to reputational risk, including those described throughout this Risk Factors\nsection, could significantly harm our reputation and our brands. Our reputation is also impacted by how we respond to corporate crises. Corporate crises can arise from\ncatastrophic events as well as from incidents involving unethical behavior or misconduct; product quality, security, or safety issues; allegations of legal noncompliance; internal\ncontrol failures; corporate governance issues; data breaches; workplace safety incidents; environmental incidents; the use of our products for illegal or objectionable applications;\nmarketing practices; media statements; the conduct of our suppliers or representatives; and other issues or incidents that, whether actual or perceived, result in adverse publicity.\nTo the extent we fail to respond quickly and effectively to address such crises, the ensuing negative public reaction could significantly harm our reputation and our brands and\ncould lead to increases in litigation claims and asserted damages or subject us to regulatory actions or restrictions.\nDamage to our reputation could reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business and operating environment. It could reduce investor confidence in us,\nadversely affecting our stock price. It may also limit our ability to be seen as an employer of choice when competing for highly skilled employees. Moreover, repairing our\nreputation and brands may be difficult, time-consuming, and expensive.\nWE ARE VULNERABLE TO PRODUCT AND MANUFACTURING-RELATED RISKS.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing process technology. Production of integrated circuits is a complex process.\nRealizing the economics of Moore’s Law is a strategic priority, and we are continually engaged in the development of next-generation process technologies at increasingly\nadvanced nodes. We are not always successful or efficient in developing or implementing new process nodes and production processes. For example, we experienced\nsignificant delays in implementing our 10nm process technology. Although we began shipping products based on our 10nm process technology in volume in 2019, our delays in\ntransitioning to this node occurred while third-party foundries developed new, competitive process technologies. Competitors using third-party foundries are able to benefit from\nthe improvements such process technologies made in performance, energy efficiency, and other features, which can help increase the competitiveness of their products.\nOur efforts to innovate involve significant expense and carry inherent risks, including difficulties in designing and developing next-generation process technologies, and\ninvestments in manufacturing assets and facilities that are made years in advance of the process node introduction. We cannot guarantee that we will realize the expected\nbenefits of next-generation process technologies, including the expected cost and density advantages, or that we will achieve an adequate return on our capital investments,\nparticularly as development of new nodes has grown increasingly expensive.\nRisks inherent in the development of next-generation process technologies include production timing delays, lower-than-anticipated manufacturing yields, longer manufacturing\nthroughput times, and product defects and errata. Production timing delays have at times caused us to miss customer product design windows, which can result in lost revenue\nopportunities and damage to our customer relationships. Furthermore, when the introduction of next-generation process nodes is delayed, including additional competitive\nfeatures in our products can result in larger die size products, manufacturing supply constraints, and increased product costs. Lower manufacturing yields and longer\nmanufacturing throughput times, compared to previous process nodes, can increase our product costs and adversely affect our gross margins, and can contribute to\nmanufacturing supply constraints. In addition, as the die size of our products has increased and our manufacturing process nodes have shrunk, our products and manufacturing\nprocesses have grown increasingly complex and more susceptible to product defects and errata, which can also contribute to production timing delays and lower yields.\nOTHER KEY INFORMATION 54\nTable of Contents\nFrom time to time, disruptions in the production process result from errors, defects in materials, delays in obtaining or revising operating permits and licenses, interruptions in our\nsupply of materials or resources, and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents, maintenance issues, or unsafe working conditions—all of\nwhich could affect the timing of production ramps and yields.\nProduction issues periodically lead to increased costs and affect our ability to meet product demand, which can adversely impact our business and the results of operations. In\naddition, to the extent we face delays in the timing of our product introductions, we could become less competitive and lose revenue opportunities, and our gross margin could be\nadversely affected because we incur significant costs up front in the product development stage and earn revenue to offset these costs over time.\nWe face supply chain risks. Thousands of suppliers provide materials and equipment that we use in production and other aspects of our business. Where possible, we seek to\nhave several sources of supply. However, for certain materials and equipment, including certain photolithography tools, we rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, or\nupon suppliers in a single location. In addition, supplier consolidation or business failures can impact the nature, quality, availability, and pricing of the products and services\navailable to us. The inability of suppliers to deliver necessary production materials or equipment can disrupt our production processes and make it more difficult for us to\nimplement our business strategy. Production can be disrupted by the unavailability of resources, such as water, silicon, electricity, gases, and other materials. The unavailability\nor reduced availability of materials or resources can require us to reduce production or incur additional costs, which could harm our business and results of operations. Our\nmanufacturing operations and ability to meet product demand may also be impacted by IP or other litigation between our suppliers, where an injunction against Intel or a supplier\ncould interrupt the availability of goods or services supplied to Intel by others.\nWe also rely on third-party providers to manufacture, assemble and test, and supply certain components or products. These have included components and products related to\nnetworking, communications, programmable semiconductor solutions, and memory, and may include these and other components and products in the future. To the extent any of\nthese third parties are unable to perform these services on a timely or cost-effective basis, in sufficient volumes, or at all, we can encounter supply delays or disruptions or incur\nadditional costs that could adversely affect our business and financial results. For example, while we have supply agreements providing for the supply of Intel® 3D XPoint™\nmemory from IMFT for a period following the close of Micron’s purchase of our interest in IMFT, we will need to fund and develop internal manufacturing options to continue 3D\nXPoint memory supply in the longer term.\nIn addition, increased regulation or stakeholder expectations regarding responsible sourcing practices could cause our compliance costs to increase or result in publicity that\nnegatively affects our reputation. Moreover, given that we use many materials in the manufacturing of our products and rely on many suppliers to provide these materials, but do\nnot directly control the procurement or employment practices of such suppliers, we could be subject to similar financial or reputational risks as a result of our suppliers' conduct.\nWe are subject to the risks of product defects, errata, or other product issues. From time to time, we identify product defects, errata (deviations from published specifications),\nand other product issues, which can result from problems in our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test processes. Components and products we purchase\nor license from third-party suppliers, or attain through acquisitions, can also contain defects. Product issues also sometimes result from the interaction between our products and\nthird-party products and software. We also face risks if products that we design, manufacture, or sell, or that include our technology, cause personal injury or property damage,\neven where the cause is unrelated to product defects or errata. These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, market segments, technologies, or\napplications, including transportation and autonomous driving, healthcare, communications, and financial services, and other industrial, critical infrastructure, and consumer uses.\nCosts from defects, errata, or other product issues could include:\n• writing off some or all of the value of inventory;\n• recalling products that have been shipped;\n• providing product replacements or modifications;\n• reimbursing customers for certain costs they incur;\n• defending against litigation and/or paying resulting damages; and\n• paying fines imposed by regulatory agencies.\nThese costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin, and result in delay or loss of revenue. Mitigation techniques designed to address product\nissues, including software and firmware updates, are not always available on a timely basis or at all, do not always operate as intended or effectively resolve such issues for all\napplications, and can result in adverse performance effects. Any product defects, errata, or other issues could damage our reputation, negatively affect product demand, delay\nproduct releases, or result in legal liability. Product defects or errata could cause customers to purchase products from competitors. Any of these occurrences could harm our\nbusiness and financial results. In addition, although we maintain liability insurance, our coverage has certain exclusions or may not adequately cover liabilities incurred. Our\ninsurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim, and losses not covered by insurance could be large, which could harm our financial condition.\nOTHER KEY INFORMATION 55\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to risks associated with environmental, health, and safety regulations. The manufacturing and assembly and test of our products require the use of hazardous\nmaterials that are subject to a broad array of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws or regulations can result in:\n• regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities;\n• suspension of production;\n• alteration of our manufacturing and assembly and test processes;\n• damage to our reputation; and\n• restrictions on our operations or sales.\nOur failure to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, or disposal of hazardous materials can lead to increased costs or future liabilities. Our\nability to expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future may be impeded by environmental regulations, such as air quality and wastewater requirements.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations sometimes require us to acquire additional pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product designs, or incur other expenses.\nRegulations in response to climate change could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution requirements, and increased compliance and energy costs.\nMany new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations are subject to regulation under environmental laws and regulations. These restrictions could harm our\nbusiness and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processes.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY RISKS.\nWe face risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents. We regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet, or to introduce malicious\nsoftware, to our IT systems. Additionally, individuals or organizations, including malicious hackers, state-sponsored organizations, insider threats including employees and thirdparty service providers, or intruders into our physical facilities, at times attempt to gain unauthorized access and corrupt the processes used to design and manufacture our\nhardware products and our associated software and services. Due to the widespread use of our products, we are a frequent target of computer hackers and organizations that\nintend to sabotage, take control of, or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other processes, products, and services. We are also a target of malicious attackers who attempt to\ngain access to our network or data centers or those of our customers or end users; steal proprietary information related to our business, products, employees, and customers;\ninterrupt our systems and services or those of our customers or others; or demand ransom to return control of such systems and services. Such attempts are increasing in\nnumber and in technical sophistication, and if successful, expose us and the affected parties to risk of loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information or disruptions of\nour business operations, including our manufacturing operations. Our IT infrastructure also includes products and services provided by third parties, and these providers can\nexperience breaches of their systems and products that impact the security of our systems and our proprietary or confidential information.\nFrom time to time, we encounter intrusions or unauthorized access to our network, products, services, or infrastructure. To date, none have resulted in any material adverse\nimpact to our business or operations. Such incidents, whether or not successful, could result in our incurring significant costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems,\nwriting down inventory value, implementing additional threat protection measures, providing modifications to our products and services, defending against litigation, responding to\nregulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, providing customers with incentives to maintain the business relationship, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third\nparties, as well as reputational harm. In addition, these threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing\nadequate preventative measures. While we seek to detect and investigate all unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network, products, and services, and to prevent their\nrecurrence where practicable through changes to our internal processes and tools and changes or updates to our products and services, we remain potentially vulnerable to\nadditional known or unknown threats. In some instances, we, our customers, and the users of our products and services can be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and\neffects.\nWe face risks related to security vulnerabilities in our products. We or third parties regularly identify security vulnerabilities with respect to our processors and other products, as\nwell as the operating systems and workloads that run on them. Components and IP we purchase or license from third parties for use in our products, as well as industry-standard\nspecifications we implement in our products, are also regularly subject to security vulnerabilities. As we have become a more data-centric company, our processors and other\nproducts are being used in additional and new critical application areas that create new or increased cybersecurity and privacy risks, including applications that gather and\nprocess large amounts of data, such as the cloud or Internet of Things, and critical infrastructure and automotive applications. The security vulnerabilities identified in our\nprocessors include a category known as side-channel exploits, such as the variants referred to as “Spectre” and “Meltdown.” Additional categories and variants have been\nidentified, such as the \"MDS\" and \"TAA\" side channel variants, and are expected to continue to be identified. Publicity about these and other security vulnerabilities has resulted\nin, and is expected to continue to result in, increased attempts by third parties to identify additional vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are not always mitigated before they become\nknown. We, our customers, and the users of our products do not always promptly learn of or have the ability to fully assess the magnitude or effects of a vulnerability, including\nthe extent, if any, to which a vulnerability has been exploited. Subsequent events or new information can develop that changes our assessment of the impact of a security\nvulnerability, including additional information learned as we develop and deploy mitigations or updates, become aware of additional variants, evaluate the competitiveness of\nexisting and new products, and address future warranty or other claims or customer satisfaction considerations, as well as developments in the course of any litigation or\nregulatory inquiries or actions over these matters.\nOTHER KEY INFORMATION 56\nTable of Contents\nMitigation techniques designed to address security vulnerabilities, including software and firmware updates or other preventative measures, are not always available on a timely\nbasis—or at all—and at times do not operate as intended or effectively resolve vulnerabilities for all applications. In addition, we are often required to rely on third parties,\nincluding hardware, software, and services vendors, as well as our customers and end users, to develop and/or deploy mitigation techniques, and the availability, effectiveness,\nand performance impact of mitigation techniques can depend solely or in part on the actions of these third parties in determining whether and how to develop and deploy\nmitigations. We and such third parties may make prioritization decisions about which vulnerabilities to address, which can delay or limit development or deployment of a\nmitigation and harm our reputation. Security vulnerabilities and/or mitigation techniques can result in adverse performance effects, reboots, system instability or unavailability,\nloss of functionality, data loss or corruption, unpredictable system behavior, decisions by customers and end users to limit or change the applications in which they use our\nproducts or product features, and/or the misappropriation of data by third parties.\nSecurity vulnerabilities and any limitations of, or adverse effects resulting from, mitigation techniques can adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, customer\nrelationships, prospects, and reputation in a number of ways, any of which may be material. For example, whether or not they involve attempted or successful exploits, they may\nresult in our incurring significant costs related to developing and deploying updates and mitigations, writing down inventory value, defending against product claims and litigation,\nresponding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, addressing customer satisfaction considerations, providing product replacements or modifications, or taking other\nremedial steps with respect to third parties. Adverse publicity about security vulnerabilities or mitigations could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce\ndemand for our products and services. These effects may be greater to the extent that competing products are not susceptible to the same vulnerabilities or if vulnerabilities can\nbe more effectively mitigated in competing products. Moreover, third parties can release information regarding potential vulnerabilities of our products before mitigations are\navailable, which, in turn, could lead to attempted or successful exploits, adversely affect our ability to introduce mitigations, or otherwise harm our business and reputation. For\nexample, information on the “Spectre” and “Meltdown” side-channel variants was prematurely reported publicly before mitigation techniques to address all vulnerabilities were\nmade widely available, and certain of the mitigation techniques did not operate as intended.\nTheft, loss, or misuse of personal data about our employees, customers, or other third parties could increase our expenses, damage our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory\nproceedings. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased business and\nsecurity costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex\nregulatory compliance environment. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant, and noncompliance could\nexpose us to significant monetary penalties, damage to our reputation, suspension of online services or sites in certain countries, and even criminal sanctions. Even our\ninadvertent failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related or data-protection laws and regulations could result in audits, regulatory inquiries, or proceedings\nagainst us by governmental entities or other third parties.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO IP RISKS AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS.\nWe cannot always enforce or protect our IP rights. We regard our patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and other IP rights as important to the success of our business. We rely on\nIP law—as well as confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers, employees, technology development partners, and others—to protect our IP rights. Our ability to\nenforce these rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our IP rights in various countries. We are not always able to enforce or\nprotect our IP rights. Enforcement is costly and time-consuming and can divert management attention. When we seek to enforce our rights, we may be subject to claims that our\nIP rights are invalid, not enforceable, or licensed to an opposing party. Our assertion of IP rights may result in another party seeking to assert claims against us, which could\nharm our business. From time to time, governments adopt regulations—and governments or courts render decisions—requiring compulsory licensing of IP rights, or governments\nrequire products to meet standards that favor local companies. Our inability to enforce our IP rights under any of these circumstances can harm our competitive position and\nbusiness. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce\nacceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in R&D, product development, and marketing could be reduced. This risk is heightened as competitors for\ntechnical talent increasingly seek to hire our employees.\nOur licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives at times allow competitors to use some of our patent rights. Technology companies often bilaterally\nlicense patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements. Some of our competitors have in the past had, and may in the future have, licenses to\nsome of our patents, and under current case law, some of the licenses can exhaust our patent rights as to licensed product sales under some circumstances. Our participation in\nindustry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives at times requires us to offer to license our patents to companies that adopt industry-standard specifications.\nDepending on the rules of the organization, government regulations, or court decisions, we sometimes have to grant licenses to some of our patents for little or no cost, and as a\nresult, we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others, and the value of our IP rights may be impaired.\nOTHER KEY INFORMATION 57\nTable of Contents\nThird parties assert claims based on IP rights against us and our products, which could harm our business. We face claims based on IP rights from individuals and companies,\nincluding claims from those who have aggregated patents acquired from multiple sources to form a new, larger portfolio to assert claims against us and other companies. Some\nof these claimants are funded by investment firms and have substantial resources, which can increase our defense costs. Additionally, large patent portfolio owners sometimes\ndivest portions of their portfolios to more than one individual or company, increasing the number of parties who own IP rights previously all held by a single party. We are typically\nengaged in a number of disputes involving IP rights. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of their merits, cause us to incur large costs\nto respond to, defend, and resolve the claims, and they divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business and operations. In addition,\nwe may face claims based on the alleged theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets or confidential information or end-user data that we obtain in\nconducting our business. Any such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business, and we could suffer losses, including the cost of product recalls and returns, and\nreputational harm. Furthermore, we have agreed to indemnify customers for certain IP rights claims against them. IP rights claims against our customers could also limit demand\nfor our products or disrupt our customers’ businesses, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs a result of IP rights claims, we could:\n• pay monetary damages, including payments to satisfy indemnification obligations, or royalties;\n• stop manufacturing, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products or technology subject to claims;\n• need to develop other products or technology not subject to claims, which could be time-consuming or costly; and/or\n• enter into settlement or license agreements, which agreements may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nThese IP rights claims could harm our competitive position, result in expenses, or require us to impair our assets. If we alter or stop production of affected items, our revenue\ncould be harmed.\nWe rely on access to third-party IP, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Many of our products include third-party technology or\nimplement industry standards, and may require licenses from third parties. Based on past experience and industry practice, we believe such licenses generally can be obtained\non commercially reasonable terms. However, there is no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use\nthird-party technology, or to license IP on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude us from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our\nfinancial condition and operating results. To the extent our products include software that contains or is derived from open-source software, we may be required to make the\nsoftware’s source code publicly available and/or license the software under open-source licensing terms.\nWe are subject to risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings. From time to time, we face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer,\ncompetition, commercial, IP, and other issues on a global basis. As described in \"Note 20: Commitments and Contingencies\" within the Consolidated Financial Statements, we\nare engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary\ndamages, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory\nlicensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome can result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, regardless of the\noutcome, litigation and regulatory proceedings can be costly, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations, and distracting to management.\nWE MUST ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE KEY EMPLOYEES.\nHiring and retaining qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff, and sales representatives are critical to our business, and competition for highly skilled employees\nin our industry is intense. In addition, changes in immigration policies may impair our ability to recruit and hire technical and professional talent. Changes in the interpretation and\napplication of employment-related laws to our workforce practices may also result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our changing workforce needs.\nTo help attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, we use share-based awards, such as RSUs, and performance-based cash incentive awards. Our employee hiring and\nretention also depend on our ability to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive workplace culture and be viewed as an employer of choice. If our share-based or other\ncompensation programs and workplace culture cease to be viewed as competitive, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees would be weakened, which could harm\nour results of operations. Furthermore, changes in our management team can disrupt our business, and the failure to successfully transition and assimilate key employees could\nadversely affect our results of operations.\nOTHER KEY INFORMATION 58\nTable of Contents\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS.\nOur acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic transactions could fail to achieve our financial or strategic objectives, disrupt our ongoing business, and adversely impact our\nresults of operations. Strategic transactions are an important component of our financial capital allocation strategy. We routinely evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements\nfor possible acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic transactions. These transactions involve numerous risks, including:\n• our inability to identify opportunities in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us;\n• failure of the transaction to advance our business strategy and of its anticipated benefits to materialize;\n• disruption of our ongoing operations and diversion of our management’s attention;\n• failure to complete a transaction in a timely manner, if at all, due to our inability to obtain required government or other approvals at all or without materially burdensome\nconditions, IP disputes or other litigation, difficulty in obtaining financing on terms acceptable to us, or other unforeseen factors;\n• our failure to realize a satisfactory return on our investment, potentially resulting in an impairment of goodwill and other assets, and restructuring charges;\n• our inability to effectively enter new market segments through our strategic transactions or retain customers and partners of acquired businesses;\n• our inability to retain key personnel of acquired businesses or our difficulty in integrating employees, business systems, and technology;\n• controls, processes, and procedures of acquired businesses that do not adequately ensure compliance with laws and regulations, and our failure to identify compliance\nissues or liabilities;\n• our failure to identify, or our underestimation of, commitments, liabilities, and other risks associated with acquired businesses or assets; and\n• the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or significant additional debt.\nMoreover, our resources are limited and our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we at times need to forgo\nthe prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our financial or strategic objectives. Where an existing investment does not meet our criteria for\nsuccess, we routinely evaluate opportunities for possible divestitures and other options. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of divestitures due to risks that include\nunfavorable prices and terms; changes in market conditions; limitations due to regulatory or governmental approvals, contractual terms, or other conditions; and continued\nfinancial obligations or unanticipated liabilities associated with such transactions. In some cases, we are not able to divest investments on acceptable terms or at all.\nAny of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, particularly in the case of a large acquisition or\nseveral concurrent acquisitions.\nWe invest in public and private companies and do not always realize a return on our investments. We make investments in public and private companies around the world to\nfurther our strategic and financial objectives and to support certain key business initiatives. Companies in which we invest range from early-stage companies still defining their\nstrategic direction to mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable and illiquid at\nthe time of our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return in a timely fashion, if at all. Our ability to realize a return on our investment in a private company,\nif any, is typically dependent on the company participating in a liquidity event, such as a public offering or acquisition. To the extent our investments are in marketable equity\nsecurities, as is typically the case for our public company investments, fluctuations in the fair value of those securities are recognized as gains or losses in our income statement,\nand consequently, declines in the fair value of these investments can reduce our net income. To the extent any of the companies in which we invest are not successful, which can\ninclude failures to achieve business objectives as well as bankruptcy, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO SALES-RELATED RISKS.\nWe face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties. We sell a significant portion of our products through third parties such as distributors, value-added\nresellers, and channel partners (collectively referred to as distributors), as well as OEMs and ODMs. We depend on many distributors to help us create end-customer demand,\nprovide technical support and other value-added services to customers, fill customer orders, and stock our products. At times, we rely on one or more key distributors for a\nproduct, and a material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors or their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue. Our ability to add or\nreplace distributors for some of our products is limited. In addition, our distributors' expertise in the determination and stocking of acceptable inventory levels for some of our\nproducts is not always easily transferable to a new distributor; as a result, end customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a distributor. Using third\nparties for distribution exposes us to many risks, including competitive pressure and concentration, credit, and compliance risks. Distributors and other third parties sell products\nthat compete with our products, and we sometimes need to provide financial and other incentives to focus them on the sale of our products. From time to time, they face financial\ndifficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws by\ndistributors or other third-party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business. Failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors and other third parties may\nreduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position.\nOTHER KEY INFORMATION 59\nTable of Contents\nFrom time to time, our products are resold by third parties in an unauthorized “gray market.” Gray market products can distort demand and pricing dynamics in our distribution\nchannel and certain geographies, which could adversely affect our revenue opportunities. Gray market activity is difficult to monitor and can make forecasting demand more\nchallenging. Gray market products also sometimes include parts that have been altered or damaged, and our reputation may be harmed when these products fail or are found to\nbe substandard.\nWe receive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers. Collectively, our three largest customers accounted for approximately 41% of our net revenue\nin 2019 and 39% of our net revenue in 2018. We expect a small number of customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future.\nIndustry trends, such as the increasing shift of data center workloads to the public cloud, have increased the significance of certain customers, particularly cloud service\nproviders, to some of our data-centric businesses. The cloud and cloud applications represent a new and increasingly demanding computing environment. The further\nconsolidation of computing workloads in the cloud, and consolidation among cloud service providers, can heighten the competitive importance of factors such as collaboration\nand customization with cloud service provider customers to optimize products for their environments; product performance; energy efficiency; feature differentiation; product\nquality, reliability, and factors affecting server uptime; and product security and security features. To the extent we do not execute effectively across these factors, our competitive\nposition and market segment share may be adversely affected. Some cloud service provider customers have also internally developed, and may continue to develop, their own\nsemiconductors, including designs customized for their specific computing workloads. The shift of data center workloads to the cloud has also adversely affected, and may\ncontinue to affect, sales to enterprise and government market segment customers when end users have elected to migrate workloads. To the extent we differentiate our products\nthrough customization to meet customer specifications, order changes, delays, or cancellations may result in non-recoverable costs.\nIf one of our key customers stops purchasing from us, materially reduces its demand for our products, or delays its orders for our products, we may experience a reduction in\nrevenue, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition. For more information about our customers, including customers who accounted for greater than 10%\nof our net consolidated revenue, see \"Note 4: Operating Segments\" within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe face risks related to transactions with government entities. We receive proceeds from U.S. federal, state, local and foreign government entities associated with grants,\nincentives, and sales of our products and services. Government demand and payment are often affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, including,\nwith respect to U.S. government contracts, congressional approval of appropriations. Government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations relating to the\naward, administration and performance of those contracts, as well as oversight and penalties for violations. For example, U.S. government contracts are subject to special rules\non accounting, IP rights, expenses, reviews, information handling, and security, and failure to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions,\nincluding termination of contracts, fines, and suspension or debarment from future business with the U.S. government.\nCHANGES IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE MAY REDUCE OUR NET INCOME.\nA number of factors can increase our effective tax rates, which could reduce our net income, including:\n• changes in the volume and mix of profits earned across jurisdictions with varying tax rates;\n• the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, including payment of interest and penalties;\n• changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances;\n• adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns;\n• increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill;\n• changes in available tax credits;\n• changes in our ability to secure new, or renew existing, tax holidays and incentives;\n• changes in U.S. federal, state, or foreign tax laws or their interpretation, including changes in the U.S. to the taxation of manufacturing enterprises and of non-U.S. income\nand expenses and changes resulting from the adoption by countries of OECD recommendations or other legislative actions;\n• changes in accounting standards; and\n• our decision to repatriate non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for local country withholding taxes incurred upon repatriation.\nWE HAVE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE AMOUNT AND FREQUENCY OF OUR STOCK REPURCHASES.\nWe are not obligated to make repurchases under our stock repurchase program, and the amount, timing, and execution of our repurchases fluctuate based on our priorities for\nthe use of cash for other purposes—such as investing in our business, including operational spending, capital spending, and acquisitions, and returning cash to our stockholders\nas dividend payments. Changes in cash flows, tax laws and other laws, and the market price of our common stock can also limit or alter the amount and frequency of our stock\nrepurchases.",
