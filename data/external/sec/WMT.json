      "item1a":"The risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our business operations could\nalso be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally.\nStrategic Risks\nGeneral or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nGeneral economic conditions, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance. Higher interest rates, lower or\nhigher prices of petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel, higher costs for electricity and other energy, weakness in the housing\nmarket, inflation, deflation, increased costs of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in consumer\ndisposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns, fluctuations in currency\nexchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes and surcharges, other changes in tax laws, other regulatory changes, overall economic slowdown and\nother economic factors could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell through our business, change the mix of products we sell to\none with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods, otherwise adversely affect our net sales and result in slower\ninventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory.\nHigher levels of unemployment, inflation, deflation, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, changes in consumer spending\nand shopping patterns, changes in tax and other laws, higher fuel and other energy costs, weakness in the local housing market, fluctuations in currency exchange\nrates, currency devaluations and other adverse developments in the economies of the other countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer demand\nfor our merchandise in those countries, especially those countries in which average incomes are significantly lower than average incomes in the U.S. These\nconditions may adversely affect our net sales, gross margins, cost of sales, inventory turnover and markdowns or otherwise adversely affect our operations and\nconsolidated operating results.\nHigher interest rates, lower or higher prices of petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel, higher costs for electricity and other\nenergy, higher transportation costs, inflation, higher commodity prices, higher costs of labor, insurance and healthcare, currency exchange rate fluctuations, higher\ntax rates and other changes in tax laws, changes in healthcare laws, the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with\ninternational trade, changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors in the U.S. and other countries in which we have operations can increase our\ncost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our domestic and international operations and our\noperating results. The economic factors that affect our operations also affect the operations and economic viability of our suppliers from whom we purchase goods,\na factor that can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, could result in certain suppliers not\nproducing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale.\nWe may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, whether involving physical retail, digital retail or the integration of\nphysical and digital retail, which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services, and our market\nshare.\nIt is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand. The success of our business depends in part on how\naccurately we predict consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment,\nwhether for customers purchasing products at our stores and clubs, through our digital retail businesses or through the combination of both retail offerings. A\ncritical piece of identifying consumer preferences involves price transparency, assortment of products, customer experience, convenience and the speed and cost of\nshipping. These factors are of primary importance to customers and they continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media\navailable to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products online, at physical locations or through a combination of both retail\nofferings. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (including the key factors described above) and spending\npatterns, whether for our physical retail offerings, digital retail offerings or the integration of physical retail and digital retail, could negatively affect our\nrelationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share.\n17\nWe face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators (whether through physical retail, digital retail or through the integration of\nboth areas), which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe retail business is highly competitive. Each of our segments competes for customers, employees, store and club sites, products and services and in other\nimportant aspects of its business with many other local, regional, national and global retailers and wholesale club operators, as well as other national and\ninternational internet-based retailers and retail intermediaries. Our Walmart U.S. segment competes with retailers operating discount, department, drug, dollar,\nvariety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores and hypermarkets, as well as e-commerce and catalog businesses. Our Sam's Club segment\ncompetes with other wholesale club operators, as well as discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors,\ngasoline stations, as well as e-commerce retailers, wholesalers and catalog businesses.\nInternationally, we compete with retailers who operate department, drug, dollar stores, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores,\nhypermarkets, wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, apparel stores, wholesale clubs, cash & carry operations, convenience stores\nand e-commerce and catalog businesses. We compete with such retailers, wholesale club operators and e-commerce retailers in a variety of ways, including the\nprices at which we sell our merchandise, the merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the\nshopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications,\ncost and speed of and options for delivery to our customers of the merchandise they purchase from us online, through mobile commerce applications and the\nintegration of our physical locations with our digital retail operations.\nWhere necessary, to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our EDLP philosophy, we will lower\nour prices on goods for sale. Our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could materially adversely affect our\nfinancial performance. See \"Item 1. Business\" above for additional discussion of our competitive situation in each of our reportable segments.\nAlthough the retail industry as a whole is highly fragmented, certain segments of the retail industry may undergo consolidation from time to time, which could\nresult in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace. Such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved\nfinancial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive\npositions. Such business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated\ncompanies, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nConsumers are increasingly embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications. As a result, a greater portion of total consumer expenditures\nwith all retailers and wholesale clubs could occur online and through mobile commerce applications. If we fail to maintain or grow our overall market position\nthrough the integration of our physical retail presence and digital retail, our net sales and financial performance could be adversely affected. In addition, a greater\nconcentration of retail and wholesale club sales in online and mobile commerce sales could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic we have in our stores and\nclubs, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-store or cross-club sales of merchandise that such in-store and in-club traffic creates and could\nreduce our sales within our stores and materially adversely affect the financial performance of the physical side of our segments’ overall operations.\nOperational Risks\nNatural disasters, changes in climate, and geo-political events could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropical storms, floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, weather conditions such as\nmajor or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, severe changes in climate and geo-political events,\nsuch as civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial\nperformance. Such events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and\ndistribution facilities, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and our associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and\nclubs directly affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution facilities are located, the unavailability\nof our retail websites and mobile commerce applications to our customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers' disposable income,\nthe temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the\ndisruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution facilities or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of\nproducts in our stores, the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities, and disruption in our communications with our stores. These events and their\nimpacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which these types of events occur, such as Superstorm Sandy in the U.S. in\n2012, or numerous winter storm systems in the U.S. in 2013, 2014 and 2015, and could adversely affect our financial performance.\n18\nIn light of the substantial premiums payable for insurance coverage for losses caused by certain natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropical\nstorms, earthquakes, floods and tsunamis in the current insurance market, as well as the limitations on available coverage for such losses, we have chosen to be\nprimarily self-insured with respect to such losses. Although we maintain certain specific coverages for losses from physical damages in excess of certain amounts\nto guard against catastrophic losses suffered from such causes, we still bear the risk of losses that would be incurred as a result of any physical damage to, or the\ndestruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption caused by any such events below catastrophic\nlevels of coverage, as well as in the event of a catastrophe, in excess of the aggregate limits of applicable coverages. Significant losses caused by such events could\nmaterially adversely affect our financial performance.\nRisks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important\nfactor in our financial performance. We expect all of our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety and environmental laws, and to\notherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards, and to access products in a timely and\nefficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the U.S.\nPolitical and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers and their manufacturers are located, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers'\nfailure to meet certain of our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their\nmanufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption in the transportation of merchandise from the\nsuppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of\nmerchandise we purchase enters into the U.S., currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the\nsuppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the U.S.'s foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the\nimportation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our\ncontrol. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance.\nIf the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers' expectations, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries suffered\nby our customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise experience material adverse effects to our financial performance.\nOur customers count on us to provide them with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers or\nthat we prepare and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and\nnon-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to\nreestablish. As such, any issue regarding the safety of any food and non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our financial\nperformance.\nWe rely extensively on information systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Disruptions in both our primary and\nsecondary (back-up) systems could harm our ability to conduct our operations.\nAlthough we have independent, redundant and physically separate primary and secondary information systems, given the number of individual transactions we\nhave each year, it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical information systems. Our information systems, including our back-up\nsystems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer\nprograms, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches (through cyberattacks from cyber-attackers and sophisticated organizations), catastrophic events such as\nfires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our associates. If our information systems and our back-up systems are damaged, breached or\ncease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the\ninterim. Any material interruption in both our information systems and back-up systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of\noperations. In addition, we are pursuing complex initiatives to transform our information technology processes and systems, which will include, for many of our\ninformation systems, establishing common processes across our lines of business. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are\nundertaken, although we believe that our change management process will mitigate this risk. If we fail to integrate our information systems and processes, we may\nfail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives.\n19\nIf the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our\nability to grow our e-commerce business globally, could be materially adversely affected.\nMany of our customers shop with us over our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including walmart.com and samsclub.com in the U.S. and\nour retail websites in 10 other countries, which are a part of our multi-channel sales strategy. Increasingly, customers are using computers, tablets, and smart\nphones to shop online and through mobile commerce applications with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping. We are increasingly using\nsocial media to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. As a part of our multi-channel sales strategy, we offer \"Walmart\nPickup\" and \"Club Pickup\" and in a growing number of locations, \"Online Grocery\" programs under which many products available for purchase online can be\nshipped to and picked up by the customer at his or her local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs.\nMulti-channel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations in the U.S. and in a number of markets in which our Walmart\nInternational segment operates.\nWe must anticipate and meet our customers' changing expectations while adjusting for new developments and technology investments by our competitors through\nfocusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating segment. Any failure on our part to provide\nattractive, user-friendly e-commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and\nthat continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and mobile commerce application merchandising and related\ntechnology could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of e-commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material\nadverse impact on the growth of our e-commerce business globally and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nAny failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our company, customers, members, associates and vendors that we hold, whether as a\nresult of cybersecurity attacks on our information systems or otherwise, could damage our reputation with customers, members, associates, vendors and\nothers, could cause us to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation, and could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nAs do most retailers, we receive and store in our digital information systems certain personal information about our customers and members, and we receive and\nstore personal information concerning our associates and vendors. We also utilize third-party service providers for a variety of reasons, including, without\nlimitation, encryption and authentication technology, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions. In addition, our online operations at\nwww.walmart.com, www.samsclub.com and our websites in certain of our foreign markets depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over\npublic networks, including information permitting cashless payments. Each year, cyber-attackers make numerous attempts to access the information stored in our\ninformation systems. We maintain substantial security measures to protect, and to prevent unauthorized access to, such information and have security processes,\nprotocols and standards that are applicable to our third-party service providers to protect information from our systems to which they have access to under their\nengagements with us.\nHowever, we or our third-party service providers may be unable to anticipate one or more of the rapidly evolving and increasingly sophisticated means by which\ncyber-attackers may attempt to defeat our security measures or those of our third-party service providers and breach our or our third-party service providers'\ninformation systems. During fiscal 2016, we were notified that a third party service provider that hosts the online photo center for Walmart Canada suffered a\nsecurity breach that compromised information of users of that company's site, including some Walmart Canada customers, which we believe has not had a material\nimpact on Walmart Canada or the Company. Walmart Canada discontinued use of this third party service provider. Sam's Club in the United States also used the\nsame third party service provider to host its online photo center through a different system than the one used by Walmart Canada. After the breach in Canada,\nSam's Club suspended the operation of the online photo center until a security review could be completed by the third party service provider. Once the security\nreview was complete and new technology with enhanced security measures was implemented by the third party service provider, along with a determination that\nthe information of Sam's Club members was not compromised by the security breach, Sam's Club resumed the operation of the online photo center through the\nsame third party service provider.\nCyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated. As cyber threats evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfully\ndefend against, one or more cyber threats might defeat our security measures or those of our third-party service providers in the future like the incident referenced\nabove and obtain the personal information of customers, members, associates and vendors that we hold or to which our third-party service providers have access,\nand we or our third-party service providers may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach\noccurs. Moreover, associate error or malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularities may result in a defeat of our or our third-party service\nproviders' security measures and breach our or our third-party service providers' information systems (whether digital or otherwise).\n20\nAny breach of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers and loss of our confidential information, which could be undetected for a period\nof time, or any failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations could cause us to incur significant costs to protect any\ncustomers and members whose personal data was compromised and to restore customer and member confidence in us and to make changes to our information\nsystems and administrative processes to address security issues and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\nIn addition, such events could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, members, associates, vendors and shareholders, as well as our\noperations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, could result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and\nfinancial condition and performance and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by\nour insurance policies. Moreover, a security breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the security\nbreach and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures that we employ to guard such important personal information against\ncyberattacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our digital retail operations.\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, our private label cards and gift cards, and we may offer new\npayment options over time, which may have information security risk implications. By accepting debit and credit cards as a retailer for payment, we are subject to\nthe Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (\"PCI DSS\"), issued by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council. PCI DSS contains compliance\nguidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of individual cardholder data. The\npayment card industry set October 1, 2015 as the date on which it will shift liability for certain transactions to retailers who are not able to accept Europay,\nMasterCard, Visa (EMV) chip card credit and debit transactions. While we already accept many EMV cards, if we are unable to fully implement EMV as planned,\nwe may incur increased costs associated with the liability shift. By accepting debit cards for payment, we are also subject to compliance with the American\nNational Standards Institute encryption standards and payment network security operating guidelines. Even though we comply with these guidelines and standards\nand other information security measures, we cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able\nto prevent, contain or detect any cyberattacks, cyber terrorism, or security breaches from known malware or malware that may be developed in the future. To the\nextent that any disruption results in the loss, damage or misappropriation of information, we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers,\nfinancial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and others. In addition, the cost of complying with stricter privacy and information security\nlaws and standards could be significant to us.\nOur failure to attract and retain qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other labor issues could materially\nadversely affect our financial performance.\nOur ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates\nglobally. Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs and\ndistribution centers, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a\nsufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we are located, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates,\nchanging demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. If we are unable to locate, to\nattract or to retain qualified personnel, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected.\nThe wage increases for over 500,000 associates in our operations in the U.S. and investment in other initiatives for our associates in the U.S. that we announced in\nFebruary 2015, and related wage increases for 1.2 million associates aggregating $1.5 billion in the year ending January 31, 2017 (\"fiscal 2017\") will increase our\nwage and other labor expenses significantly. If we cannot offset the increases in our wage expenses resulting from those wage increases by increasing our gross\nprofit, achieving decreases in our operating, selling, general and administrative expense or a combination of both in the year ending January 31, 2018 and\nthereafter, our consolidated operating income and our consolidated income from continuing operations could continue to be less than our consolidated operating\nincome and consolidated income from continuing operations for our fiscal years prior to fiscal 2017. In addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase even\nmore significantly for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented that further increase our\nlabor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.\n21\nWe may face impediments to our expansion of physical retail in the U.S., which may materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur expansion strategy in the U.S. depends upon our ability to execute our retail concepts successfully in new markets within the U.S. and upon our ability to\nincrease the number of stores in markets in which we currently have operations. Our ability to open additional supercenters, discount stores, Neighborhood\nMarkets, other store formats, and Sam's Clubs depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain qualified personnel and to acquire new store sites\non acceptable terms. Local real estate, land use, zoning, and other regulations restricting the construction of buildings of the type in which we operate our various\nformats, as well as local community action opposed to the location of specific stores at specific sites and the adoption of certain local laws restricting our\noperations, may affect our ability to open new stores and clubs, to convert discount stores into supercenters or to relocate or expand existing units in certain cities\nand states, including in market areas in which we have no existing operations.\nIncreased real estate, construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities and our ability to convert our discount stores into supercenters.\nMoreover, our expansion in our existing local market areas may be limited if the opening of new stores or clubs would result in an unacceptable level of\ncannibalization of the sales of existing stores or clubs. If we are unable to open new supercenters, discount stores, Neighborhood Markets, other small formats or\nSam's Clubs or continue to convert discount stores into supercenters, our financial performance, such as net sales and operating income growth, could be materially\nadversely affected. In addition, if consumers in the markets into which we expand or in which we build stores of a new format are not receptive to our retail\nconcepts or are otherwise not receptive to our presence in a market, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nImpediments to the expansion of our Walmart International operations could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur business strategy for our Walmart International segment includes expansion by selective acquisitions and strategic alliances that add new stores and markets to\nour existing Walmart International business, as well as opening new units in the countries in which we have existing operations. In the countries in which we have\nexisting operations, new units may be opened in the formats already existing in those countries or may be opened in newly introduced formats, such as\nsupercenters or Sam's Clubs, not previously operated in those markets. As in the U.S., our ability to open new stores or to expand or relocate existing stores in a\nmarket served by our Walmart International segment depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain qualified personnel and our ability to\nacquire new store sites on acceptable terms. Local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive pre-existing buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to\nbuild new units or to expand existing units. In addition, access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand\nproduct selections in existing units in certain markets, especially in those markets in which consumers desire to purchase locally produced goods.\nMoreover, cultural differences in some markets into which we expand or into which we introduce new retail concepts may result in the consumers in those markets\nnot being as receptive to our retail concepts as we anticipate those consumers will be and may make an effective response to such issues more difficult to achieve.\nEconomic, business and legal environments in foreign markets may be such that we are unable to expand our operations and increase our net sales in those markets\nas we may want to do and could result in the closure of our existing units in such markets, which closures impede the growth of our international operations.\nFinally, some countries have foreign investment laws that prohibit us or limit us from holding a controlling interest in retail operations in those countries, making\nour entry into those markets, which may present attractive growth opportunities, more difficult, if not impossible. If we cannot effectively continue to expand our\nWalmart International segment, our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices and may not be successful in completing the acquisition of any such\ncandidate identified. Although we ultimately believe we will be able to successfully integrate any newly acquired operations into our existing operations, no\ncertainty exists that future acquisitions or alliances will be successfully integrated into our operations or can be successfully integrated in a reasonable time. Our\nfailure to identify appropriate candidates for acquisition or alliance or to integrate effectively future acquisitions and alliances into our existing operations could\nadversely affect the growth of our Walmart International segment and our future financial performance.\nFinancial Risks\nFluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations.\nOur operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries. Our consolidated financial statements are\ndenominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expenses\nof our operations outside of the U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. In recent years, fluctuations in currency\nexchange rates that were unfavorable to us coupled with such translations have had a material adverse effect on our reported results of\n22\noperations. As a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our\nconsolidated financial statements reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period\nimprovement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable currency\nexchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect\non our reported consolidated results of operations.\nWe may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the\ngoods will be sold. When we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable\nto us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with\na corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.\nFailure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.\nWe believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these\nexpectations, including our comparable store and club sales growth rates, e-commerce growth rates, gross margin, earnings and earnings per share or new store and\nclub openings could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies.\nRegulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks\nOur operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic risks and conditions specific to\nthe countries or regions in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance.\nWe are currently engaged in the operation of retail through our wholly-owned subsidiaries operating in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, India, Japan and\nthe United Kingdom; our majority-owned subsidiaries operating in Africa, Central America and Mexico; and our joint ventures and other controlled subsidiaries in\nChina in addition to our U.S. operations. During fiscal 2016 , our Walmart International operations generated approximately 26% of our consolidated net sales. Our\ndivisions also source goods and services from other countries. The future expansion of our operations in countries outside the U.S. could result in our international\noperations accounting for a larger portion of our net sales in future years. Our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions throughout\nthe world could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, including political\ninstability, local and global economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, local product safety and environmental laws, tax regulations, local labor laws,\nanti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, currency regulations, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or\nin the future.\nIn particular, Brazilian federal, state and local laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although the Company believes it complies with those laws,\nthe Company's subsidiaries in Brazil are party to a large number of labor claims and non-income tax assessments, which have arisen during the normal course of\nbusiness in Brazil. These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and if decided adversely to the Company, could materially adversely affect our financial\nperformance.\nMoreover, the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations,\nwhich, if they occurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade,\nmonetary and fiscal policies both of the U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar\norganizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the U.S. Additional risks\ninherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences\nand greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also\nexist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in\nculture, laws and regulations.\nIn foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business\npractices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the laws and regulations of other countries such as\nthe UK Bribery Act. We maintain policies prohibiting such business practices and have in place enhanced global anti-corruption compliance programs designed to\nensure compliance with these laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including\nthose based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will\nengage in business practices that are prohibited by our\n23\npolicies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies,\ncould adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation.\nWe are also subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. The\ndetermination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. Our income taxes\ncould be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in\njurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or\naccounting principles.\nWe are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing\ntax regulations and legislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts\nrecorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which\nsuch determination and settlement is made.\nWe are subject to certain legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe are involved in a number of legal proceedings, which include consumer, employment, tort and other litigation. In particular, we are currently a defendant in a\nnumber of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws, as well as a number of\ncases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws.\nIn addition, ASDA Stores, Ltd. (\"ASDA\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has been named as a defendant in over 7,000 \"equal value\" claims that are\npending in the Manchester Employment Tribunal (the \"Employment Tribunal\") in the United Kingdom. The claimants, who are current and former ASDA store\nemployees, allege that the work performed by female employees in ASDA's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their\njobs to that of male employees working in ASDA's warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is not\nobjectively justified. The claimants are seeking: (i) back pay consisting of the difference between the wage rate paid in the stores and the rate paid in the\nwarehouses and distribution facilities for the period of their employment up to a maximum of six years under the statute of limitations; and (ii) an increase in the\nstore rate prospectively, to match that paid in the warehouses and the distribution facilities. On January 30, 2015, the Employment Tribunal held a case\nmanagement conference in order to set a schedule for addressing jurisdictional challenges and other issues involved in the first phase of the litigation. At this time,\nit is undetermined: (i) how many of these claims may ultimately be filed; or (ii) whether the Employment Tribunal will decide to hear each claim individually or to\nconsolidate them into groups of similar claims and proceed with the trial of \"test cases.\" Determinations made in such test cases, if any, might be asserted as\nbinding in subsequent trials of claims within that group and any subsequent claims involving the same issues. Moreover, a determination as to the appropriate rate\nof pay for a particular store position might be asserted as the basis for additional claims for back pay or wage increases by other store associates who perform, or\nwho have performed, like work in that position.\nOn March 23, 2015, ASDA asked the Employment Tribunal to stay all proceedings, contending that the High Court, which is the superior first instance civil court\nin the UK that is headquartered in the Royal Courts of Justice in the City of London, is the more convenient and appropriate forum to hear these claims. On March\n23, 2015, ASDA also asked the Employment Tribunal to \"strike out\" substantially all of the claims for failing to comply with Employment Tribunal rules.\nFollowing argument and appellate proceedings, the claims have remained in the Employment Tribunal. The issue of stay, strike out, and the scope of Employment\nTribunal rules are the subject of further appellate proceedings. We discuss this case and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption \"Item 3.\nLegal Proceedings\" and in Note 10 in the \"Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements,\" which are part of our Annual Report to Shareholders, which are\nincorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n24\nWe could be subject to liability, penalties and other sanctions and other adverse consequences arising out of our on-going FCPA matter.\nThe Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, which is composed solely of independent directors, is conducting an internal investigation into, among other\nthings, alleged violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and other alleged crimes or misconduct in connection with certain of our foreign\nsubsidiaries, including Wal-Mart de México, S.A.B. de C.V., or Walmex, and whether we appropriately handled prior allegations of such violations and/or\nmisconduct. We are also conducting a voluntary global review of our policies, practices and internal controls for FCPA compliance and strengthening our global\nanti-corruption compliance programs. Since the implementation of the global review and enhanced anti-corruption compliance programs, the Audit Committee and\nwe have identified or been made aware of additional allegations regarding potential violations of the FCPA. Inquiries or investigations regarding allegations of\npotential FCPA violations have been commenced in a number of foreign markets in which we operate, including, but not limited to, Brazil, China and India. In\nNovember 2011, we voluntarily disclosed our investigative activity to the U.S. Department of Justice (the \"DOJ\") and the SEC, and we have been informed by the\nDOJ and the SEC that we are the subject of their respective investigations into possible violations of the FCPA. A number of federal and local government\nagencies in Mexico have also initiated investigations of these matters. Furthermore, lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation have been filed by several\nof our shareholders against us, certain of our current and former directors and officers and certain of Walmex's current and former officers.\nWe could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of these matters. One or more enforcement actions could be instituted in respect of the\nmatters that are the subject of some or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments, settlements, fines,\npenalties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, debarment or other relief, criminal convictions and/or penalties. The existing and any additional shareholder lawsuits\nmay result in judgments against us and our current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings. We cannot predict at this time the outcome or\nimpact of the government investigations, the shareholder lawsuits, or our own internal investigations and review. Moreover, we expect to continue to incur costs\n(incremental to the $126 million of costs incurred in fiscal 2016 and the costs incurred in prior years) in conducting our on-going review and investigations and in\nresponding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimony and other information in connection with the government investigations and in\ndefending the existing and any additional shareholder lawsuits and any governmental proceedings that are instituted against us or any of our current or former\nofficers. These matters may require the involvement of certain members of our senior management that could impinge on the time they have available to devote to\nother matters relating to our business. We also expect that there will be ongoing media and governmental interest, including additional news articles from media\npublications on these matters that could impact the perception of our role as a corporate citizen among certain audiences. Our process of assessing and responding\nto the governmental investigations and the shareholder lawsuits continues. While we believe that it is probable that we will incur a loss from these matters, given\nthe on-going nature and complexity of the review, inquiries and investigations, we cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these\nmatters. Although we do not presently believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, given the inherent uncertainties in such\nsituations, we can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to our business in the future.",

      "item1a":"Strategic Risks\nGeneral or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nGeneral economic conditions and other economic factors, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance.\nHigher interest rates, lower or higher prices of petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel, higher costs for electricity and other\nenergy, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, increased costs of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of\nunemployment, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes in consumer spending and\nshopping patterns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes and surcharges or other changes in tax laws, changes in\nhealthcare laws, other regulatory changes, the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, overall\neconomic slowdown and other economic factors in the U.S. or in any of the other markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer demand for the\nproducts we sell in the U.S. or such other markets, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary\npurchases of goods, adversely affect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory, or otherwise materially adversely\naffect our operations and operating results.\nIn addition, the economic factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation, labor, insurance or healthcare costs\nor commodity prices, and other economic factors in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general\nand administrative expenses and otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results.\nThe economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers, which can result in an increase in the cost to us of the\ngoods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale.\nWe may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers,\ndemand for the products and services we sell, our market share and the growth of our business.\nIt is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their shopping patterns. The success of\nour business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products\nand the competitive environment, whether for customers purchasing products at our stores and clubs, through our digital retail businesses or through the\ncombination of both retail offerings. Price transparency, assortment of products, customer experience, convenience and the speed and cost of shipping are of\nprimary importance to customers and continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the\nchoices available to consumers for purchasing products. As a result of these factors, we\n17\nplan to increase investments in e-commerce, technology, store remodels and other customer initiatives, moderate the number of new store openings and rely to a\ngreater extent on comparable store sales and e-commerce for growth. Any failure of these investments or initiatives to adequately or effectively respond to\nchanging consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns, or any other failure on our part to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes,\npreferences and shopping patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for the products we sell, our market share and the\ngrowth of our business.\nWe face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators (whether through physical retail, digital retail or the integration of both),\nwhich could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe retail business is highly competitive. Each of our segments competes for customers, employees, store and club sites, products and services and in other\nimportant aspects of its business with many other local, regional, national and global retailers and wholesale club operators, as well as other national and\ninternational internet-based retailers and retail intermediaries.\nOur Walmart U.S. segment competes with retailers operating discount, department, retail and wholesale grocers, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores,\nsupermarkets, supercenter-type stores and hypermarkets, as well as e-commerce and catalog businesses. Our Sam's Club segment competes with other wholesale\nclub operators, as well as discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations, and e-commerce\nretailers, wholesalers and catalog businesses.\nInternationally, we compete with retailers who operate department, drug, dollar stores, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores,\nhypermarkets, wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, apparel stores, wholesale clubs, cash & carry operations, convenience stores\nand e-commerce and catalog businesses.\nWe compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers,\nlocation, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our e-commerce\nwebsites and mobile commerce applications, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased online, through mobile commerce\napplications or through the integration of our physical and digital retail operations.\nWhere necessary, to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our EDLP philosophy, we will lower\nour prices on goods for sale. A failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could materially adversely affect our\nfinancial performance. See \" Item 1. Business \" above for additional discussion of the competitive situation of each of our reportable segments.\nAlthough the retail industry as a whole is highly fragmented, certain segments of the retail industry may undergo consolidation from time to time, which could\nresult in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace. Such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved\nfinancial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive\npositions. Such business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated\ncompanies, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nFailure to grow our e-commerce business through the integration of physical and digital retail or otherwise, and the cost of our increasing e-commerce\ninvestments, may materially adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance.\nThe retail business is quickly evolving and consumers are increasingly embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications. As a result, the\nportion of total consumer expenditures with all retailers and wholesale clubs occurring online and through mobile commerce applications is increasing and the pace\nof this increase could accelerate. We plan to increase our investments in e-commerce, technology, store remodels and other customer initiatives, moderate the\nnumber of new store openings and rely to a greater extent on increasing comparable store and club sales and e-commerce sales (which are included in our\ncalculation of comparable store and club sales with the exception of e-commerce acquisitions until such businesses have been owned for 12 months) for growth.\nThe success of this strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to build and deliver a seamless shopping experience across the physical and digital retail\nchannels and is further subject to the risks we face as outlined in this Item 1A . Our investments in e-commerce, technology, store remodels and other customer initiatives may not adequately or effectively allow us to grow our e-commerce\nbusiness, increase comparable store sales, maintain or grow our overall market position or otherwise offset the impact on the growth of our business of a moderated\npace of new store and club openings. If we fail to successfully implement our strategy, our market position, net sales and financial performance could be adversely\naffected. In addition, a greater concentration of e-commerce sales could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, which would, in turn,\nreduce the opportunities for cross-store or cross-club sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and\nmaterially adversely affect the financial performance of the physical retail side of our operations.\n18\nIn addition, the cost of certain e-commerce and technology investments, including any operating losses incurred by acquired e-commerce businesses will adversely\nimpact our financial performance in the short-term and may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term.\nOperational Risks\nNatural disasters, changes in climate, and geo-political events could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropical storms, floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, weather conditions such as\nmajor or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, severe changes in climate and geo-political events,\nsuch as civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial\nperformance.\nSuch events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution\nfacilities, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs affected by\nsuch events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution facilities are located, the unavailability of our retail websites and\nmobile commerce applications to our customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers' disposable income, the temporary or long-term\ndisruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the\ndelivery of goods to our distribution facilities or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our stores, the\ndisruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities, and disruption in our communications with our stores.\nThese events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which they occur, such as Superstorm Sandy in the U.S.\nin 2012 or the numerous storm systems in the U.S. in recent years, and could adversely affect our financial performance.\nIn light of the substantial premiums payable for insurance coverage for losses caused by certain natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropical\nstorms, earthquakes, floods and tsunamis, as well as the limitations on available coverage for such losses, we have chosen to be primarily self-insured with respect\nto such losses. Although we maintain certain specific coverages for losses from physical damages in excess of certain amounts to guard against catastrophic losses\nfrom such causes, we still bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of any physical damage to, or the destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution facilities,\nloss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption caused by any such events to the extent they are below catastrophic levels of coverage, as well as in the\nevent of a catastrophe, to the extent they exceed our aggregate limits of applicable coverages. Significant losses caused by such events could materially adversely\naffect our financial performance.\nRisks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important\nfactor in our financial performance. We expect all of our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety and environmental laws, and to\notherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards, and to access products in a timely and\nefficient manner, is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the U.S.\nPolitical and economic instability in the countries in which our foreign suppliers and their manufacturers are located, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers'\nfailure to meet certain of our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their\nmanufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption in the transportation of merchandise from the\nsuppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of\nmerchandise we purchase enters into the U.S., currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the\nsuppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the U.S.'s foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the\nimportation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our\ncontrol. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance.\nIf the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers' expectations, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries suffered\nby customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise experience material adverse effects to our brand, reputation and financial performance.\nOur customers count on us to provide them with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers or\nthat we prepare and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and\nnon-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is\n19\noutside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish. As such, any issue regarding the safety of any\nfood or non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our brand, reputation and financial performance.\nWe rely extensively on information systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Disruptions in both our primary and\nsecondary (back-up) systems could harm our ability to conduct our operations.\nAlthough we have independent, redundant and physically separate primary and secondary information systems, given the number of individual transactions we\nhave each year, it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical information systems. Our information systems, including our back-up\nsystems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer\nprograms, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches (through cyber-attacks from cyber-attackers and sophisticated organizations), catastrophic events such as\nfires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our associates. Our information systems are essential to our business operations, including the\nprocessing of transactions, management of our associates, facilities, logistics, inventories, physical stores and clubs and our online operations. If our information\nsystems and our back-up systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and\nwe may suffer interruptions in our business operations in the interim. Any interruption in both our information systems and back-up systems may have a material\nadverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we are pursuing complex initiatives to transform our information technology processes and\nsystems. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken, although we believe our change management process will\nmitigate this risk. If we fail to integrate our information systems and processes, we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these\ninitiatives.\nIf the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our\nability to grow our e-commerce business globally, could be materially adversely affected.\nMany of our customers shop with us over our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, which are a part of our multi-channel sales strategy.\nIncreasingly, customers are using computers, tablets, and smart phones to shop online and through mobile commerce applications with us and with our competitors\nand to do comparison shopping. We use social media and electronic mail to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. As a\npart of our multi-channel sales strategy, in addition to home delivery, we offer \"Walmart Pickup,\" \"Pickup Today\" and \"Club Pickup\" and in a growing number of\nlocations, \"Online Grocery\" programs under which many products available for purchase online can be picked up by the customer at a local Walmart store or Sam's\nClub, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs. Multi-channel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our\noperations in the U.S. and in a number of markets in which our Walmart International segment operates.\nWe must anticipate and meet our customers' changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors' operations\nthrough focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating segment. Any failure on our part to provide\nattractive, user-friendly secure e-commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery\noptions and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and mobile commerce application merchandising and\nrelated technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of e-commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a\nmaterial adverse impact on the growth of our e-commerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nOur e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope, and\nthe computer systems and operating systems on which they run, including those applications and systems in our acquired e-commerce businesses, may be subject to\ncyber-attacks. Those attacks could involve attempts to gain access to the website or mobile commerce application to obtain and make unauthorized use of\ncustomers' or members' payment information and related risks discussed below. Such attacks, if successful, can also create denials of service or otherwise disable,\ndegrade or sabotage one or more of our retail websites or mobile commerce applications and otherwise significantly disrupt our customers' and members' shopping\nexperience on any of our retail website or mobile commerce applications. If we are unable to maintain the security of our retail commerce websites and mobile\ncommerce applications and keep them operating within acceptable parameters, we could suffer loss of sales, reductions in traffic, reputational damage and\ndeterioration of our competitive position and incur liability for any damage to customers whose personal information is unlawfully obtained and used, any of which\nevents could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our business.\n20\nAny failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our company, customers, members, associates and vendors, whether as a result of\ncybersecurity attacks on our information systems or otherwise, could damage our reputation, result in litigation or other legal actions against us, cause us\nto incur substantial additional costs, and materially adversely affect our business and operating results.\nAs do most retailers, we receive and store in our digital information systems certain personal information about our customers and members, and we receive and\nstore personal information concerning our associates and vendors. Some of that information is stored digitally in connection with our e-commerce websites and\nmobile commerce applications. We also utilize third-party service providers for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, for encryption and\nauthentication technology, content delivery to customers and members, back-office support, and other functions. Such providers may have access to information\nwe hold about our customers, members, associates or vendors. In addition, our online operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information\nover public networks, including information permitting cashless payments.\nCyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly\nsophisticated. Cyber threats and cyber-attackers can be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of single \"hackers\" or small\ngroups of \"hackers.\" Each year, cyber-attackers make numerous attempts to access the information stored in our information systems. We have in place substantial\nsecurity measures to protect, and to prevent unauthorized access to, our information systems and the information stored on such systems. We also have security\nprocesses, protocols and standards that are applicable to our third-party service providers, including cloud service providers, to protect information from our\nsystems which they have access to or hold under their engagements with us.\nWe constantly monitor developments in cyber threats, evaluate the effectiveness of our information security measures and change such measures or implement new\nand additional security measures from time to time to address new and different risks to the security of such information and to strengthen our protections for the\ninformation stored on our systems. We require our third-party service providers to do the same. Nevertheless, as cyber threats evolve, change and become more\ndifficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber-attacks might defeat our or a third-party service provider's security measures in the future and\nobtain the personal information of customers, members, associates and vendors.\nAssociate error or malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularities may also result in a defeat of our or our third-party service providers' security\nmeasures and a breach of our or their information systems. Moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may have inherent defects of design, manufacture\nor operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security. We or our third-party service\nproviders may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach occurs.\nAny breach of our security measures or any breach, error or malfeasance of those of our third-party service providers and loss of our confidential information, or\nany failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations, could cause us to incur significant costs to protect any\ncustomers, members, associates and vendors whose personal data was compromised and to restore their confidence in us and to make changes to our information\nsystems and administrative processes to address security issues and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\nIn addition, such events could be widely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, members, associates, vendors and\nshareholders, as well as our operations, net sales, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity, could result in the release to the public of\nconfidential information about our operations and financial condition and performance and could result in litigation or other legal actions against us or the\nimposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies. Moreover, a security breach could require us to devote\nsignificant management resources to address the problems created by the security breach and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the\nsecurity measures we employ to guard personal information against cyber-attacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption of\nour operations, particularly our digital retail operations.\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, our private label credit cards and gift cards, and we may offer new\npayment options over time, which may have information security risk implications. As a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to\nvarious industry data protection standards and protocols, such as the American National Standards Institute encryption standards and payment network security\noperating guidelines and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. Even though we comply with these standards and protocols and other information\nsecurity measures, we cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent, contain or\ndetect any cyber-attacks, cyber terrorism, or security breaches from known cyber-attacks or malware that may be developed in the future. To the extent that any\ncyber-attack or incursion in our or one of our third-party service provider's information systems results in the loss, damage or misappropriation of information, we\nmay be materially adversely affected by claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and others. In certain\ncircumstances, payment card association rules and obligations to which we are subject under our contracts with payment card processors make us liable to payment\ncard issuers if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we hold is compromised, which liabilities could be substantial. In\naddition, the cost of\n21\ncomplying with stricter and more complex data privacy, data collection and information security laws and standards could be significant to us.\nChanges in the results of our retail pharmacy business could adversely affect our overall results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nThe retail pharmacy operations in our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments generate substantial net sales, a large majority of which are generated by filling\nprescriptions for which we receive payment established through contractual relationship with third-party payers and payment administrators, such as private\ninsurers, governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers (\"PBMs\").\nOur retail pharmacy operations are subject to numerous risks, including: reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates for drugs; changes in our payer mix (i.e.,\nshifts in the relative distribution of our pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorable\nreimbursement terms); changes in third party payer drug formularies (i.e., the schedule of prescription drugs approved for reimbursement or which otherwise\nreceive preferential coverage treatment); growth in, and our participation in or exclusion from, exclusive and preferred pharmacy network arrangements operated\nby PBMs and/or any insurance plan or program; increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription drugs we sell; increases in the\nadministrative burden associated with seeking third-party reimbursement; changes in the frequency with which new brand name pharmaceuticals become available\nto consumers; introduction of lower cost generic drugs as substitutes for existing brand name drugs for which there was no prior generic drug competition; changes\nin drug mix (i.e., the relative distribution of drugs customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands and generics); changes in the health insurance market\ngenerally; changes in the scope of or the elimination of Medicare Part D or Medicaid drug programs; increased competition from other retail pharmacy operations;\nfurther consolidation among third party payers, PBMs or purchasers of drugs; overall economic conditions and the ability of our pharmacy customers to pay for\ndrugs prescribed for them to the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a third party; failure to meet any performance or incentive thresholds to which our level of\nthird party reimbursement may be subject; and changes in the regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry and the pharmaceutical industry, including\nas a result of restrictions on the further implementation of or the repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or the enactment and implementation of a\nlaw replacing such act, and other changes in laws, rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business.\nIf the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of vendors were to be disrupted for any reason, our pharmacy operations could be severely\naffected until at least such time as we could obtain a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals. Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a\nsignificant number of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies.\nOne or a combination of such factors may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell, our cost of sales associated with our\nretail pharmacy operations, and the net sales and gross margin of those operations, result in the loss of cross-store or -club selling opportunities and, in turn,\nadversely affect our overall net sales, other results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nOur failure to attract and retain qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other labor issues could materially\nadversely affect our financial performance.\nOur ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates\nglobally. Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs and\ndistribution centers, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a\nsufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates,\nchanging demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. If we are unable to locate, to\nattract or to retain qualified personnel, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected.\nThe wage increases for over 500,000 associates in our operations in the U.S. and investment in other initiatives for our associates in the U.S. that we announced in\nFebruary 2015, and related wage increases for 1.2 million associates occurring in February 2016 have increased our wage and other labor expenses significantly. If\nwe cannot offset the increases in our wage and other labor expenses resulting from those wage increases by increasing our gross profit, achieving decreases in our\noperating, selling, general and administrative expense or a combination of both, our consolidated operating income and our consolidated income from continuing\noperations could continue to be less than our consolidated operating income and consolidated income from continuing operations for our fiscal years prior to fiscal\n2017. In addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase even more significantly for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or\nhealthcare laws are adopted or implemented that further increase our labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.\n22\nImpediments to the expansion of our Walmart International operations, and the performance of strategic alliances to support the expansion of that\nsegment, could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur business strategy for our Walmart International segment includes opening new units and growing comparable stores sales in the countries in which we have\nexisting operations. Our ability to open new units or to expand or relocate existing units depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain\nqualified personnel and acquire new store sites on acceptable terms. Local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive pre-existing buildings in which to locate\nunits or sites on which to build new units or to expand existing units.\nIn addition, access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand product selections in existing units in certain\nmarkets, especially in those markets in which consumers desire to purchase locally produced goods. Economic, business and legal environments in foreign markets\nmay also limit our ability to expand our operations and increase our net sales in those markets as we may want and could result in the closure of existing units in\nsuch markets which may adversely impact our financial results. If we cannot effectively continue to expand our Walmart International segment through opening\nnew units, growing comparable store sales or selective acquisitions, our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected.\nOur Walmart International segment may also enter into strategic alliances in the countries in which we have existing operations or in other markets to expand our\ndigital retail operations, physical retail operations or both. For example, in fiscal 2017, we entered into a strategic alliance with JD.com, Inc. providing for Walmart\nChina to be a preferred retailer on its online-to-offline platform and our Sam's Club business in China to be a flagship store on its marketplace. Any strategic\nalliance may not generate the level of e-commerce or other sales we anticipate when entering into that alliance or may otherwise adversely impact our business\nrelative to the results we could have achieved in the absence of such alliance. In addition, any investment we make in connection with a strategic alliance, such as\nour investment in JD.com, Inc., could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nFinancial Risks\nFluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations.\nOur operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries. Our consolidated financial statements are\ndenominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expenses\nof our operations outside of the U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. In recent years, fluctuations in currency\nexchange rates that were unfavorable to us coupled with such translations have had a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations.\nAs a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our consolidated\nfinancial statements reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in our\nfinancial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable currency exchange rate\nfluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our\nreported consolidated results of operations.\nWe may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the\ngoods will be sold. When we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable\nto us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with\na corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.\n23\nFailure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.\nWe believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these\nexpectations, including our comparable store and club sales growth rates, e-commerce growth rates, gross margin, or earnings and earnings per share could cause\nthe market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies.\nLegal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks\nOur operations subject us to legislative, judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or\nregions in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance.\nIn addition to our U.S. operations, we operate our retail business principally through wholly-owned subsidiaries in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, India,\nJapan and the United Kingdom and our majority-owned subsidiaries in Africa, Central America and Mexico.\nIn fiscal 2017, our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club operating segments generated approximately 76% of our consolidated net sales. The Federal Government has\ncreated the potential for significant changes in trade policies, including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries\nwhere we source many of the products we sell in our stores and clubs. Potential changes which have been discussed include the renegotiation or termination of\ntrade agreements, the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S. and the imposition of a border tax, or a border adjustment tax, on imports into the U.S. A\nsignificant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our U.S. stores and clubs is manufactured in other countries. Any such actions could increase the cost to us\nof such merchandise (whether imported directly or indirectly) and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers, which could\nmaterially adversely affect the financial performance of our U.S. operations and our business.\nDuring fiscal 2017 , our Walmart International operations generated approximately 24% of our consolidated net sales. Our operating segments also source goods\nand services from other countries. Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our\ncontrol. These factors include political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, local\nproduct safety and environmental laws, tax regulations, local labor laws, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, currency regulations, and other\nmatters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future.\nThe potential imposition by the U.S. of a border tax or border adjustment tax, new or higher tariffs or other restrictions on trade discussed above which impact a\ncountry in which we have operations could result in actions by that country to impose new, or increase existing tariffs or taxes on products imported into such\ncountry from the U.S. or elsewhere and could damage the reputations of U.S.-based companies, including us, with customers and others in that country. This could\nmaterially adversely affect the financial performance of our operations in such country or countries.\nOur business and results of operations in the UK may be negatively affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, increases in food costs, changes in trade\npolicies, or changes in labor, immigration, tax or other laws resulting from the UK's anticipated exit from the European Union.\nBrazilian federal, state and local laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although the Company believes it complies with those laws, the\nCompany's subsidiaries in Brazil are party to a large number of labor claims and non-income tax assessments, which have arisen during the normal course of\nbusiness in Brazil. These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and if decided adversely to the Company, could materially adversely affect our financial\nperformance.\nThe economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they\noccurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and\nfiscal policies of the U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks\nassociated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the U.S. Additional risks inherent in our international\noperations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in\nenforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing\nbusiness outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and\nregulations.\nIn foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business\npractices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"), or the laws and regulations of other\ncountries, such as the UK Bribery Act. We maintain policies prohibiting such business practices and have in place enhanced global anti-corruption compliance\nprograms designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our\n24\nassociates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations\nof other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so,\nviolate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance and\nour reputation.\nWe are also subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. The\nU.S. Congress and the current federal administration have identified federal tax reform as a priority for 2017. Federal tax reform plans under consideration may\nresult in significant changes to the U.S. tax code. Some of the changes contemplated by the U.S. Congress, like the border tax or border adjustment tax, could have\nthe effect of increasing our effective tax rate, the amount of our consolidated net taxable income subject to income taxes, and our overall tax liability, and could\nreduce our net income and our earnings per share, as well as our consolidated cash flows and liquidity, even if the changes include a reduction in the rate at which\ncorporate taxable income is taxed. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities\nrequires judgment and estimation. Our income taxes could also be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have\nlower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and\nliabilities, or by changes in worldwide tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles.\nWe are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing\ntax regulations and legislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded\nin our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which such\ndetermination and settlement is made.\nWe are subject to certain legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe are involved in a number of legal proceedings, which include consumer, employment, tort and other litigation. In particular, we are currently a defendant in a\nnumber of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws, as well as a number of\ncases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws.\nIn addition, ASDA Stores, Ltd. (\"ASDA\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has been named as a defendant in nearly 10,000 \"equal value\" claims\npending in the Manchester Employment Tribunal (the \"Employment Tribunal\") in the United Kingdom. The claimants, who are current and former ASDA store\nemployees, allege that the work performed by female employees in ASDA's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs\nto that of male employees working in ASDA's warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is not\nobjectively justified. The claimants are seeking differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouses and distribution facilities and higher wage rates\non a prospective basis. At present, we cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may\narise from these proceedings. We discuss this case and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption \" Item 3. Legal Proceedings \" and in Note 10\nin the \"Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements,\" which are part of our Annual Report to Shareholders, which are incorporated by reference in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K and are included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe could be subject to liability, penalties and other sanctions and other adverse consequences arising out of our on-going FCPA matter.\nThe Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has been conducting an internal investigation into, among other things, alleged violations of the FCPA and other\nalleged crimes or misconduct in connection with certain of our foreign subsidiaries, including Wal-Mart de México, S.A.B. de C.V. (\"Walmex\"), and whether prior\nallegations of such violations and/or misconduct were appropriately handled by the Company. We have also been conducting a voluntary global review of our\npolicies, practices and internal controls for anti-corruption compliance and are engaged in strengthening our global anti-corruption compliance programs. Since the\nimplementation of the global review and enhanced anti-corruption compliance programs, the Audit Committee and we have identified or been made aware of\nadditional allegations regarding potential violations of the FCPA.\nInquiries or investigations regarding allegations of potential FCPA violations have been commenced in a number of foreign markets in which we operate,\nincluding, but not limited to, Brazil, China and India. In November 2011, we voluntarily disclosed our investigative activity to the U.S. Department of Justice (the\n\"DOJ\") and the SEC. We have been cooperating with those agencies and discussions have begun with them regarding the resolution of these matters. As\ndiscussions regarding resolution are preliminary, we cannot currently predict the timing, the outcome or the impact of a possible resolution of these matters. A\nnumber of federal and local government agencies in Mexico have also initiated investigations of these matters. Furthermore, lawsuits relating to the matters under\ninvestigation have been filed by several of our shareholders against us, certain of our current and former directors and officers and certain of Walmex's current and\nformer officers.\n25\nWe could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of these matters. One or more enforcement actions could be instituted in respect of the\nmatters that are the subject of some or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments, settlements, fines,\npenalties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, debarment or other relief, criminal convictions and/or penalties. The shareholder lawsuits may result in judgments\nagainst us and our current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings. We also expect that there will be ongoing media and governmental interest\nregarding these matters, including additional news articles on these matters that could impact the perception of our role as a corporate citizen among certain\naudiences. Moreover, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimony\nand other information in connection with the government investigations, in defending the shareholder lawsuits and in conducting our review and investigations.\nWhile we believe it is probable we will incur a loss from these matters, given the on-going nature and complexity of the review, inquiries and investigations we\ncannot yet reasonably estimate a loss or range of loss that may arise from the conclusion of these matters. Although we do not presently believe that these matters\nwill have a material adverse effect on our business, given the inherent uncertainties in such situations, we can provide no assurance that these matters will not be\nmaterial to our business in the future.",

Our Sam's Club segment competes with other\nwholesale club operators, as well as discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations, as well as\ndigital retailers and catalog businesses.\n17\nOur Walmart International segment competes with both physical retailers who operate department, drug, discount, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets,\nhypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, cash & carry operations and convenience stores,\nand digital retailers, as well as catalog businesses.\nWe compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers,\nlocation, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital\nplatforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through the omni-channel integration\nof our physical and digital retail operations.\nA failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets or delays or failure in execution of our strategy could materially\nadversely affect our financial performance. See \" Item 1. Business \" above for additional discussion of the competitive situation of each of our reportable segments.\nCertain segments of the retail industry are undergoing consolidation, which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail\nmarketplace. Such consolidation, or other business combinations or alliances, may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access\nto merchandise, greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions. Such business combinations or\nalliances could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated or aligned companies, which could\nadversely affect our financial performance.\nWe may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers,\ndemand for the products and services we sell, our market share and the growth of our business.\nIt is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their shopping patterns. The success of\nour business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products\nand the competitive environment, whether for customers purchasing products at our stores and clubs, through our digital platforms or through the combination of\nboth. Price transparency, assortment of products, customer experience, convenience and the speed and cost of shipping are of primary importance to customers and\ncontinue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for\npurchasing products. Our failure to adequately or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns, or any other failure on our\npart to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our\ncustomers, the demand for the products we sell, our market share and the growth of our business.\nFailure to grow our eCommerce business through the omni-channel integration of physical and digital retail or otherwise, and the cost of our increasing\neCommerce investments, may materially adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance.\nThe retail business is rapidly evolving and consumers are increasingly embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications. As a result, the\nportion of total consumer expenditures with retailers and wholesale clubs occurring through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase could\naccelerate.\nOur strategy, which includes investments in eCommerce, technology, store remodels and other customer initiatives may not adequately or effectively allow us to\ngrow our eCommerce business, increase comparable store sales, maintain or grow our overall market position or otherwise offset the impact on the growth of our\nbusiness of a moderated pace of new store and club openings. The success of this strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to build and deliver a\nseamless omni-channel shopping experience and is further subject to the risks we face as outlined in this Item 1A . As a result, our market position, net sales and\nfinancial performance could be adversely affected. In addition, a greater concentration of eCommerce sales could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in\nour stores and clubs, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-store or cross-club sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our\nsales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect the financial performance of the physical retail side of our operations.\nFurthermore, the cost of certain eCommerce and technology investments, including any operating losses incurred by acquired eCommerce businesses will\nadversely impact our financial performance in the short-term and may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term.\nThe performance of strategic alliances to support the expansion of our Walmart International segment could materially adversely affect our financial\nperformance.\nOur Walmart International segment may enter into strategic alliances in the countries in which we have existing operations or in other markets to expand our digital\nretail operations, physical retail operations or both. Any strategic alliance may not generate the level of eCommerce or other sales we anticipate when entering into\nthat alliance or may otherwise adversely impact our\n18\nbusiness and competitive position relative to the results we could have achieved in the absence of such alliance. In addition, any investment we make in connection\nwith a strategic alliance could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOperational Risks\nNatural disasters, changes in climate, and geo-political events could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, typhoons, weather conditions\nsuch as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, severe changes in climate and geo-political\nevents, such as war, civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and\nfinancial performance.\nSuch events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution\nfacilities, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs affected by\nsuch events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution facilities are located, the unavailability of our digital platforms to\nour customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers' disposable income, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of\nproducts from some local and overseas suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our\ndistribution facilities or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our stores, the disruption of utility services\nto our stores and our facilities, and disruption in our communications with our stores.\nWe bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to, or destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory and\nbusiness interruption caused by such events. These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which they\noccur and could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nRisks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor\nin our financial performance. We expect all of our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety and environmental laws, and to otherwise meet\nour required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient\nmanner, is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the U.S.\nPolitical and economic instability in the countries in which our foreign suppliers and their manufacturers are located, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers'\nfailure to meet certain of our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their\nmanufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption in the transportation of merchandise from the\nsuppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of\nmerchandise we purchase enters into the U.S., currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the\nsuppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the U.S.'s foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the\nimportation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control.\nThese and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance.\nIf the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers' expectations, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries suffered\nby customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise experience material adverse effects to our brand, reputation and financial performance.\nOur customers count on us to provide them with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers or\nthat we prepare and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and\nnon-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to\nreestablish. As such, any issue regarding the safety of any food or non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our brand, reputation and\nfinancial performance.\n19\nWe rely extensively on information systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Disruptions in our systems could harm\nour ability to conduct our operations.\nGiven the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is crucial that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical information systems.\nOur information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other\nmalicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches (through cyber-attacks from cyber-attackers and sophisticated organizations),\ncatastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our associates or contractors. Our information systems are essential to\nour business operations, including the processing of transactions, management of our associates, facilities, logistics, inventories, physical stores and clubs and our\nonline operations. Our information systems are not fully redundant and if our systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly, we may have to make a\nsignificant investment to repair or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our business operations in the interim. Any interruption to our information\nsystems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we are constantly updating our information technology processes\nand systems. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken. If we fail to timely integrate and update our information\nsystems and processes, we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives.\nIf the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our\nability to grow our eCommerce business globally, could be materially adversely affected.\nMany of our customers shop with us using our digital platforms, which are a part of our omni-channel sales strategy. Increasingly, customers are using computers,\ntablets, and smart phones to shop online and through digital platforms with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping. We use social media and\nelectronic mail to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. As a part of our omni-channel sales strategy, in addition to\nhome delivery, we offer \"Walmart Pickup,\" \"Pickup Today\" and \"Club Pickup\" and, in a growing number of locations, \"Online Grocery\" programs under which\nmany products available for purchase online can be picked up by the customer at a local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional customer traffic at\nsuch stores and clubs. Omni-channel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations in the U.S. (whether through organic growth or\neCommerce acquisitions) and in a number of markets in which our Walmart International segment operates.\nWe must anticipate and meet our customers' changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors' operations\nthrough focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating segment. Any failure on our part to provide\nattractive, user-friendly secure digital platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and\nthat continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and digital platform merchandising and related technology could\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of eCommerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the\ngrowth of our eCommerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nOur digital platforms, which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope, and the computer and operating systems on\nwhich they run, including those applications and systems in our acquired eCommerce businesses, may be subject to cyber-attacks. Those attacks could involve\nattempts to gain access to one of our eCommerce websites or mobile commerce applications to obtain and make unauthorized use of customers' or members'\npayment information and related risks discussed below. Such attacks, if successful, can also create denials of service or otherwise disable, degrade or sabotage one\nor more of our digital platforms and otherwise significantly disrupt our customers' and members' shopping experience. If we are unable to maintain the security of\nour digital platforms and keep them operating within acceptable parameters, we could suffer loss of sales, reductions in traffic, reputational damage and\ndeterioration of our competitive position and incur liability for any damage to customers whose personal information is unlawfully obtained and used, any of which\nevents could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our business.\nAny failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our company, customers, members, associates and vendors, whether as a result of\ncybersecurity attacks on our information systems or otherwise, could damage our reputation, result in litigation or other legal actions against us, cause us\nto incur substantial additional costs, and materially adversely affect our business and operating results.\nAs do most retailers, we receive and store in our digital information systems certain personal information about our customers and members, and we receive and\nstore personal information concerning our associates and vendors. Some of that information is stored digitally in connection with our digital platforms. We also\nutilize third-party service providers for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, for encryption and authentication technology, content delivery to\ncustomers and members, back-office support, and other functions. Such providers may have access to information we hold about our customers, members,\nassociates or vendors. In addition, our eCommerce operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including\ninformation permitting cashless payments.\n20\nCyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly\nsophisticated. Cyber threats and cyber-attackers can be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of single \"hackers\" or small\ngroups of \"hackers.\" Each year, cyber-attackers make numerous attempts to access the information stored in our information systems. As cyber threats evolve,\nchange and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber-attacks might defeat our or a third-party service provider's security\nmeasures in the future and obtain the personal information of customers, members, associates and vendors.\nAssociate error or malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularities may also result in a defeat of our or our third-party service providers' security\nmeasures and a breach of our or their information systems. Moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may have inherent defects of design, manufacture\nor operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security. We or our third-party service\nproviders may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach occurs.\nAny breach of our security measures or any breach, error or malfeasance of those of our third-party service providers and loss of our confidential information, or\nany failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations, could cause us to incur significant costs to protect any\ncustomers, members, associates and vendors whose personal data was compromised and to restore their confidence in us and to make changes to our information\nsystems and administrative processes to address security issues and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\nIn addition, such events could be widely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, members, associates, vendors and\nshareholders, could harm our competitive position particularly with respect to our eCommerce operations, and could result in a material reduction in our net sales in\nour eCommerce operations, as well as in our stores thereby materially adversely affecting our operations, net sales, results of operations, financial condition, cash\nflows and liquidity. Such events could also result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and financial condition and\nperformance and could result in litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by our\ninsurance policies. Moreover, a security breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the security breach\nand to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to guard personal information against cyber-attacks and other\nattempts to access such information and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our digital retail operations.\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, our private label credit cards and gift cards, and we may offer new\npayment options over time, which may have information security risk implications. As a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to\nvarious industry data protection standards and protocols, such as payment network security operating guidelines and the Payment Card Industry Data Security\nStandard. We cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent, contain or detect\nany cyber-attacks, cyber terrorism, or security breaches from known cyber-attacks or malware that may be developed in the future. To the extent that any cyberattack or incursion in our or one of our third-party service provider's information systems results in the loss, damage or misappropriation of information, we may be\nmaterially adversely affected by claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and others. In certain circumstances,\npayment card association rules and obligations to which we are subject under our contracts with payment card processors make us liable to payment card issuers if\ninformation in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we hold is compromised, which liabilities could be substantial. In addition, the\ncost of complying with stricter and more complex data privacy, data collection and information security laws and standards could be significant to us.\nChanges in the results of our retail pharmacy business could adversely affect our overall results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nWalmart has retail pharmacy operations in our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments and a large majority of the retail pharmacy net sales are generated by filling\nprescriptions for which we receive payment through established contractual relationships with third-party payers and payment administrators, such as private\ninsurers, governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers (\"PBMs\").\nOur retail pharmacy operations are subject to numerous risks, including: reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates for drugs; changes in our payer mix (i.e.,\nshifts in the relative distribution of our pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorable\nreimbursement terms); changes in third party payer drug formularies (i.e., the schedule of prescription drugs approved for reimbursement or which otherwise\nreceive preferential coverage treatment); growth in, and our participation in or exclusion from, exclusive and preferred pharmacy network arrangements operated\nby PBMs and/or any insurance plan or program; increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription drugs we sell; increases in the\nadministrative burdens associated with seeking third-party reimbursement; changes in the frequency with which new brand name pharmaceuticals become available\nto consumers; introduction of lower cost generic drugs as substitutes for existing brand name drugs for which there was no prior generic drug competition; changes\nin drug mix (i.e., the relative distribution of drugs customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands and generics); changes\n21\nin the health insurance market generally; changes in the scope of or the elimination of Medicare Part D or Medicaid drug programs; increased competition from\nother retail pharmacy operations; further consolidation among third party payers, PBMs or purchasers of drugs; overall economic conditions and the ability of our\npharmacy customers to pay for drugs prescribed for them to the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a third party; failure to meet any performance or incentive\nthresholds to which our level of third party reimbursement may be subject; and changes in the regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry and the\npharmaceutical industry, including as a result of restrictions on the further implementation of or the repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or the\nenactment and implementation of a law replacing such act, and other changes in laws, rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business.\nIf the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted for any reason, our pharmacy operations could be severely\naffected until at least such time as we could obtain a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals. Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a\nsignificant number of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies.\nOne or a combination of such factors may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell, our cost of sales associated with our\nretail pharmacy operations, and the net sales and gross margin of those operations, result in the loss of cross-store or cross-club selling opportunities and, in turn,\nadversely affect our overall net sales, other results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nOur failure to attract and retain qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other labor issues could materially adversely\naffect our financial performance.\nOur ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates\nglobally. Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs and\ndistribution centers, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a\nsufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates,\nchanging demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. If we are unable to locate, to\nattract or to retain qualified personnel, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or\nimplemented that further increase our labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.\nFinancial Risks\nFluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations.\nOur operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries. Our consolidated financial statements are\ndenominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expenses\nof our operations outside of the U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. In recent years, fluctuations in currency\nexchange rates that were unfavorable to us coupled with such translations have had a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations.\nAs a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our consolidated\nfinancial statements reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in our\nfinancial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable currency exchange rate\nfluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported\nconsolidated results of operations.\nWe may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the\ngoods will be sold. When we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable\nto us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with\na corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.\nFailure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.\nWe believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these\nexpectations, including our comparable store and club sales growth rates, eCommerce growth\n22\nrates, gross margin, or earnings and earnings per share could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase\nprograms or policies. Additionally, failure of Walmart's performance to match that of other retailers may have a negative effect on the price of our stock.\nLegal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks\nOur operations subject us to legislative, judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or\nregions in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance.\nIn addition to our U.S. operations, we operate our retail business principally through wholly-owned subsidiaries in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, India,\nJapan and the United Kingdom and our majority-owned subsidiaries in Africa, Central America and Mexico.\nIn fiscal 2018, our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club operating segments generated approximately 76% of our consolidated net sales. The Federal Government has\ncreated the potential for significant changes in trade policies, including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries\nwhere we source many of the products we sell in our stores and clubs. Potential changes which have been discussed include the renegotiation or termination of\ntrade agreements and the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S. A significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our U.S. stores and clubs\nis manufactured in other countries. Any such actions could increase the cost to us of such merchandise (whether imported directly or indirectly) and cause increases\nin the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers, which could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our U.S. operations and our\nbusiness.\nDuring fiscal 2018, our Walmart International operations generated approximately 24% of our consolidated net sales. Walmart International's operations in various\ncountries also sources goods and services from other countries. Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors,\nmost of which are beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions, legal and\nregulatory constraints, local product safety and environmental laws, tax regulations, local labor laws, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies,\ncurrency regulations, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future.\nOur business and results of operations in the UK may be negatively affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, increases in food costs, changes in trade\npolicies, or changes in labor, immigration, tax or other laws resulting from the UK's anticipated exit from the European Union.\nBrazilian federal, state and local laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although the Company believes it complies with those laws, the\nCompany's subsidiaries in Brazil are party to a large number of labor claims and non-income tax assessments, which have arisen during the normal course of\nbusiness in Brazil. These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and if decided adversely to the Company, could materially adversely affect our financial\nperformance.\nThe economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they\noccurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and\nfiscal policies of the U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks\nassociated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the U.S. Additional risks inherent in our international\noperations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in\nenforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing\nbusiness outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and\nregulations.\nIn foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business\npractices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"), or the laws and regulations of other\ncountries, such as the UK Bribery Act. We maintain a global policy prohibiting such business practices and have in place a global anti-corruption compliance\nprogram designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors\nor agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may\nbe customary, will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and\nregulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation.\nWe are subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. The\ndetermination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. Our income taxes\ncould be materially adversely affected by earnings being\n23\nlower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes\nin the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in worldwide tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") was enacted and contains significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective in 2018,\nthe Tax Act reduces the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and creates new taxes focused on foreign-sourced earnings and related-party\npayments. In addition, the Company was subject to a one-time transition tax in fiscal 2018 on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to\nU.S. income tax. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\"SAB 118\") on December 22, 2017, which\nallows companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Due to the timing of the\nenactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, the Company made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional\namounts in our financial statements as of January 31, 2018, in accordance with SAB 118. As the Company collects and prepares necessary data, and interprets the\nTax Act and any additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, the Company may make adjustments to\nthe provisional amounts during fiscal 2019. Those adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which\nthe adjustments are made and could impact our net income and our earnings per share, as well as our consolidated cash flows and liquidity.\nWe are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing\ntax regulations and legislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded\nin our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which such\ndetermination and settlement is made.\nWe operate in complex regulated environments in the United States and in the other countries in which we operate and could be adversely affected by changes to\nexisting legal requirements including the related interpretations and enforcement practices, new legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicable\nregulations. Our pharmacy operations in the United States are subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations including licensing and other requirements\nfor pharmacies and reimbursement arrangements. The regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: federal and state registration and\nregulation of pharmacies; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; applicable governmental payer regulations\nincluding Medicare and Medicaid; data privacy and security laws and regulations including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the Affordable\nCare Act or any successor thereto; laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing\nexposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances; regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration (the \"FDA\") and the Drug Enforcement Administration (the \"DEA\"), trade regulations including those of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and\nconsumer protection and safety regulations including those of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the\navailability, sale, advertisement and promotion of products we sell and the financial services we offer; anti-kickback laws; false claims laws; and federal and state\nlaws governing health care fraud and abuse and the practice of the professions of pharmacy, optical care and nurse practitioner services.\nFor example, in the United States the DEA and various other regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled\nsubstances. We are required to hold valid DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state\ncontrolled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale, dispensing, disposal, holding and distribution of controlled substances. The DEA, FDA and\nstate regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative\nsanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. We are also governed by foreign, national and state laws of general applicability, including laws regulating\nmatters of working conditions, health and safety and equal employment opportunity and other labor and employment matters, as well as employee benefit,\ncompetition, anti-money laundering, antitrust matters and health and wellness related regulations for our pharmacy operations outside of the United States. Changes\nin laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may alter the landscape in which we do business and may significantly\naffect our cost of doing business.\nThe impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicable\nlaws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to\nimplement, increase our operating costs and require significant capital expenditures. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations\ncould result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses, including: suspension of\npayments from government programs; loss of required government certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs,\nincluding the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the United States; loss of licenses; and significant fines or monetary damages and/or penalties. Any failure to\ncomply with applicable regulatory requirements in the United States or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial\n24\nexposure, damage our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to certain legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe are involved in a number of legal proceedings, which include consumer, employment, tort and other litigation. In particular, we are currently a defendant in a\nnumber of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws, as well as a number of\ncases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws.\nIn addition, ASDA Stores, Ltd. (\"ASDA\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has been named as a defendant in over 10,000 \"equal value\" claims\npending in the Manchester Employment Tribunal (the \"Employment Tribunal\") in the United Kingdom. The claimants, who are current and former ASDA store\nemployees, allege that the work performed by female employees in ASDA's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs\nto that of male employees working in ASDA's warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is not\nobjectively justified. The claimants are seeking differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouses and distribution facilities and higher wage rates\non a prospective basis. At present, we cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may\narise from these proceedings.\nIn December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various\nplaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payors, asserting claims generally concerning the\nimpacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) , and is\npending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in this multidistrict\nlitigation, including cases filed by several counties in West Virginia; by healthcare providers in Mississippi, Alabama, Texas, and Florida; and by the St. Croix\nChippewa Indians of Wisconsin. Similar cases that name the Company have been filed in state courts by various counties and municipalities; by health care\nproviders; and by various Native American Tribes. At present, we cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any\nloss or range of loss that may arise from such claims.\nWe discuss these cases and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption \" Item 3. Legal Proceedings \" and in Note 10 in the \" Notes to our\nConsolidated Financial Statements ,\" which are part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe could be subject to liability, penalties and other sanctions and other adverse consequences arising out of our on-going FCPA matter.\nThe Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has been conducting an internal investigation into, among other things, alleged violations of the FCPA and other\nalleged crimes or misconduct in connection with certain of our foreign subsidiaries, including Wal-Mart de México, S.A.B. de C.V. (\"Walmex\"), and whether prior\nallegations of such violations and/or misconduct were appropriately handled by the Company. We have also been conducting a voluntary global review of our\npolicies, practices and internal controls for anti-corruption compliance and are engaged in strengthening our global anti-corruption compliance programs. Since the\nimplementation of the global review and enhanced anti-corruption compliance programs, the Audit Committee and we have identified or been made aware of\nadditional allegations regarding potential violations of the FCPA.\nInquiries or investigations regarding allegations of potential FCPA violations have been commenced in a number of foreign markets in which we operate,\nincluding, but not limited to, Brazil, China and India. In November 2011, we voluntarily disclosed our investigative activity to the U.S. Department of Justice (the\n\"DOJ\") and the SEC. We have been cooperating with those agencies and discussions have been ongoing with them regarding the resolution of these matters. These\ndiscussions have progressed to a point that we can now reasonably estimate a probable loss and have recorded an aggregate accrual of $283 million with respect to\nthese matters (the \"Accrual\").\nA number of federal and local government agencies in Mexico have also initiated investigations of these matters. Furthermore, lawsuits relating to the matters\nunder investigation have been filed by several of our shareholders against us, certain of our current and former directors and officers and certain of Walmex's\ncurrent and former officers.\nWe could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of these matters. One or more enforcement actions could be instituted in respect of the\nmatters that are the subject of some or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments, settlements, fines,\npenalties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, debarment or other relief, criminal convictions and/or penalties. The shareholder lawsuits may result in judgments\nagainst us and our current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings. We also expect that there will be ongoing media and governmental interest\nregarding these matters, including additional news articles on these matters that could impact the perception of our role as a corporate citizen among certain\naudiences. Moreover, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimony\nand other information in\n25\nconnection with the government investigations, in defending the shareholder lawsuits and in conducting our review and investigations.\nWhile we have made an Accrual for these matters, because the discussions are continuing, there can be no assurance as to the timing or the terms of the final\nresolution of these matters. Although we do not presently believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, given the inherent\nuncertainties in such situations, we can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to our business in the future.",

Higher interest rates, lower or higher prices\nof petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel, higher costs for electricity and other energy, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, increased costs of\nessential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes in\nconsumer spending and shopping patterns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes or other changes in tax laws, changes in healthcare laws, other regulatory\nchanges, the imposition of tariffs or other measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, overall economic slowdown or recession and other economic factors in\nthe U.S. or in any of the other markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer demand for the products we sell in the U.S. or such other markets, change the mix of products we sell to one\nwith a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods, adversely affect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory, or\notherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results and could result in impairment charges to intangible assets, goodwill or other long-lived assets.\nIn addition, the economic factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation, labor, insurance or healthcare costs or commodity prices, and other\neconomic factors in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses and otherwise materially adversely affect\nour operations and operating results.\nThe economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers, which can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more\nextreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale.\nWe\nface\nstrong\ncompetition\nfrom\nother\nretailers\nand\nwholesale\nclub\noperators\nwhich\ncould\nmaterially\nadversely\naffect\nour\nfinancial\nperformance.\nEach of our segments competes for customers, employees, digital prominence, products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional, national and global\neCommerce and omni-channel retailers, wholesale club operators and retail intermediaries.\nWe compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities,\nthe shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise\npurchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and digital operations.\n15\nA failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets or delays or failure in execution of our strategy could materially adversely affect our financial performance. See\n\" Item 1. Business \" above for additional discussion of the competitive situation of each of our reportable segments.\nCertain segments of the retail industry are undergoing consolidation, which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace. Other segments are\nsubstantially reducing operations which could also result in competition rushing to fill the void created by such corporate actions. Such consolidation, or other business combinations or alliances, or\nreduction in operation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other\nimprovements in their competitive positions. Such business combinations or alliances could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated\nor aligned companies, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe\nmay\nnot\ntimely\nidentify\nor\neffectively\nrespond\nto\nconsumer\ntrends\nor\npreferences,\nwhich\ncould\nnegatively\naffect\nour\nrelationship\nwith\nour\ncustomers,\ndemand\nfor\nthe\nproducts\nand\nservices\nwe\nsell,\nour\nmarket\nshare\nand\nthe\ngrowth\nof\nour\nbusiness.\nIt is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their shopping patterns. The success of our business depends in part on how\naccurately we predict consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment. Price transparency, assortment of products,\ncustomer experience, convenience, ease and the speed and cost of shipping are of primary importance to customers and continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and\nsocial media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products. Our failure to adequately or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and\nshopping patterns, or any other failure on our part to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns could negatively affect our relationship with\nour customers, the demand for the products we sell, our market share and the growth of our business.\nFailure\nto\nsuccessfully\nexecute\nour\nomni-channel\nstrategy\nand\nthe\ncost\nof\nour\nincreasing\neCommerce\ninvestments\nmay\nmaterially\nadversely\naffect\nour\nmarket\nposition,\nnet\nsales\nand\nfinancial\nperformance.\nThe retail business is rapidly evolving and consumers are increasingly embracing shopping digitally. As a result, the portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers and wholesale clubs occurring\nthrough digital platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase could accelerate.\nOur strategy, which includes acquisitions, joint ventures, investments in eCommerce, technology, store remodels and other customer initiatives may not adequately or effectively allow us to grow our\neCommerce business, increase comparable store sales, maintain or grow our overall market position or otherwise offset the impact on the growth of our business of a moderated pace of new store and\nclub openings. The success of this strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to build and deliver a seamless omni-channel shopping experience and is further subject to the risks we face as\noutlined in this Item 1A . As a result, our market position, net sales and financial performance could be adversely affected, which could also result in impairment charges to intangible assets or other\nlong-lived assets. In addition, a greater concentration of eCommerce sales could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for\ncross-store or cross-club sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nFurthermore, the cost of certain eCommerce and technology investments, including any operating losses incurred will adversely impact our financial performance in the short-term and may adversely\nimpact our financial performance over the longer term.\nThe\nperformance\nof\nstrategic\nalliances\nand\nother\nbusiness\nrelationships\nto\nsupport\nthe\nexpansion\nof\nour\nbusiness\ncould\nmaterially\nadversely\naffect\nour\nfinancial\nperformance.\nWe may enter into strategic alliances and other business relationships in the countries in which we have existing operations or in other markets to expand our retail operations. These arrangements may\nnot generate the level of sales we anticipate when entering into the arrangement or may otherwise adversely impact our business and competitive position relative to the results we could have achieved in\nthe absence of such alliance. In addition, any investment we make in connection with a strategic alliance or business relationship could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOperational\nRisks\nNatural\ndisasters,\nchanges\nin\nclimate,\nand\ngeo-political\nevents\ncould\nmaterially\nadversely\naffect\nour\nfinancial\nperformance.\nThe occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, typhoons, weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms,\ndroughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, severe changes in climate and geo-political events, such as war, civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a\n16\ncountry in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.\nSuch events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution facilities, the lack of an adequate work\nforce in a market, the inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores,\nclubs and distribution facilities are located, the unavailability of our digital platforms to our customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers' disposable income, the\ntemporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution\nfacilities or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our stores, the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities, and disruption in\nour communications with our stores.\nWe bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to, or destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by such\nevents. These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which they occur and could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nRisks\nassociated\nwith\nour\nsuppliers\ncould\nmaterially\nadversely\naffect\nour\nfinancial\nperformance.\nThe products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. We\nexpect our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety, anti-corruption and environmental laws, and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find\nqualified suppliers who uphold our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient manner, is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the\nU.S.\nPolitical and economic instability in the countries in which our foreign suppliers and their manufacturers are located, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet certain of our supplier\nstandards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety and\nquality issues, disruption in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which\na material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the markets in which we operate, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating\nto the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the U.S. foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of\ngoods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could\nadversely affect our financial performance.\nIf\nthe\nproducts\nwe\nsell\nare\nnot\nsafe\nor\notherwise\nfail\nto\nmeet\nour\ncustomers'\nexpectations,\nwe\ncould\nlose\ncustomers,\nincur\nliability\nfor\nany\ninjuries\nsuffered\nby\ncustomers\nusing\nor\nconsuming\na\nproduct\nwe\nsell\nor\notherwise\nexperience\na\nmaterial\nimpact\nto\nour\nbrand,\nreputation\nand\nfinancial\nperformance.\nWe\nmay\nalso\nface\nreputational\nand\nother\nrisks\nrelated\nto\nthird-party\nsales\non\nour\ndigital\nplatforms.\nOur customers count on us to provide them with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers or that we prepare and then sell could\ncause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control.\nAny lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish and may also expose us to product liability or food safety claims. As such, any issue regarding the safety of\nany food or non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our brand, reputation and financial performance. In addition, third-parties sell goods on some of our digital platforms,\nwhich we refer to as marketplace transactions. The applicability to us of laws related to such sales is currently unsettled and we may face reputational, financial and other risks, including liability, for\nthird-party sales of goods that are counterfeit or otherwise fraudulent.\nWe\nrely\nextensively\non\ninformation\nsystems\nto\nprocess\ntransactions,\nsummarize\nresults\nand\nmanage\nour\nbusiness.\nDisruptions\nin\nour\nsystems\ncould\nharm\nour\nability\nto\nconduct\nour\noperations.\nGiven the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is crucial that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical information systems. Our information systems are subject to\ndamage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches\n(through cyber-attacks from cyber-attackers and sophisticated organizations), catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our associates or contractors.\nOur information systems are essential to our business operations, including the processing of transactions, management of our associates, facilities, logistics, inventories, physical stores and clubs and\nour online operations. Our information systems are not fully\n17\nredundant and if our systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our\nbusiness operations in the interim. Any interruption to our information systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we are constantly updating our\ninformation technology processes and systems. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken. If we fail to timely integrate and update our information\nsystems and processes, we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives.\nIf\nthe\ntechnology-based\nsystems\nthat\ngive\nour\ncustomers\nthe\nability\nto\nshop\nwith\nus\nonline\ndo\nnot\nfunction\neffectively,\nour\noperating\nresults,\nas\nwell\nas\nour\nability\nto\ngrow\nour\neCommerce\nbusiness\nglobally,\ncould\nbe\nmaterially\nadversely\naffected.\nIncreasingly, customers are using computers, tablets, and smart phones to shop with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping. We use social media and electronic mail to interact with\nour customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. As a part of our omni-channel sales strategy, in addition to home delivery, we offer \"Walmart Pickup,\" \"Pickup Today,\" \"Club\nPickup\" and \"Online Grocery\" programs under which many products available for purchase online can be picked up by the customer at a local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional\ncustomer traffic at such stores and clubs. Omni-channel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations in the U.S. (whether through organic growth or eCommerce\nacquisitions) and in a number of markets in which our Walmart International segment operates.\nWe must anticipate and meet our customers' changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors' operations through focusing on the building and\ndelivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating segment. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, user-friendly secure digital platforms that offer a wide assortment\nof merchandise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and digital platform\nmerchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of eCommerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact\non the growth of our eCommerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nOur digital platforms, which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope, and the computer and operating systems on which they run, including those\napplications and systems in our acquired eCommerce businesses, are regularly subject to cyber-attacks. Those attacks involve attempts to gain access to our eCommerce websites (including marketplace\nplatforms) or mobile commerce applications to obtain and make unauthorized use of customers' or members' payment information and related risks discussed below. Such attacks, if successful, may also\ncreate denials of service or otherwise disable, degrade or sabotage one or more of our digital platforms and otherwise significantly disrupt our customers' and members' shopping experience. If we are\nunable to maintain the security of our digital platforms and keep them operating within acceptable parameters, we could suffer loss of sales, reductions in traffic, reputational damage and deterioration of\nour competitive position and incur liability for any damage to customers whose personal information is unlawfully obtained and used, any of which events could have a material adverse impact on our\nbusiness and results of operations and impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our business.\nAny\nfailure\nto\nmaintain\nthe\nsecurity\nof\nthe\ninformation\nrelating\nto\nour\ncompany,\ncustomers,\nmembers,\nassociates\nand\nvendors,\nwhether\nas\na\nresult\nof\ncybersecurity\nattacks\non\nour\ninformation\nsystems\nor\notherwise,\ncould\ndamage\nour\nreputation,\nresult\nin\nlitigation\nor\nother\nlegal\nactions\nagainst\nus,\ncause\nus\nto\nincur\nsubstantial\nadditional\ncosts,\nand\nmaterially\nadversely\naffect\nour\nbusiness\nand\noperating\nresults.\nAs do most retailers, we receive and store in our digital information systems certain personal information about our customers and members, and we receive and store personal information concerning\nour associates and vendors. Some of that information is stored digitally in connection with our digital platforms. We also utilize third-party service providers for a variety of reasons, including, without\nlimitation, for encryption and authentication technology, content delivery to customers and members, back-office support, and other functions. Such providers may have access to information we hold\nabout our customers, members, associates or vendors. In addition, our eCommerce operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including\ninformation permitting cashless payments.\nCyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Cyber threats and\ncyber-attackers can be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of single \"hackers\" or small groups of \"hackers.\" Each year, cyber-attackers make numerous\nattempts to access the information stored in our information systems. As cyber threats evolve, change and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber-attacks\nmight defeat our or a third-party service provider's security measures in the future and obtain the personal information of customers, members, associates and vendors.\n18\nAssociate error or malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularities may also result in a defeat of our or our third-party service providers' security measures and a breach of our or their\ninformation systems. Moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may have inherent defects of design, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used\nin a manner that could compromise information security. We or our third-party service providers may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the\nsecurity breach occurs.\nAny breach of our security measures or any breach, error or malfeasance of those of our third-party service providers and loss of our confidential information, or any failure by us to comply with\napplicable privacy and information security laws and regulations, could cause us to incur significant costs to protect any customers, members, associates and vendors whose personal data was\ncompromised and to restore their confidence in us and to make changes to our information systems and administrative processes to address security issues and compliance with applicable laws and\nregulations.\nIn addition, such events could be widely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, members, associates, vendors and shareholders, could harm our competitive\nposition particularly with respect to our eCommerce operations, and could result in a material reduction in our net sales in our eCommerce operations, as well as in our stores thereby materially\nadversely affecting our operations, net sales, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity. Such events could also result in the release to the public of confidential information about\nour operations and financial condition and performance and could result in litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by\nour insurance policies. Moreover, a security breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the security breach and to expend significant\nadditional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to guard personal information against cyber-attacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption\nof our operations, particularly our digital operations.\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, our private label credit cards and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time, which may\nhave information security risk implications. As a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols, such as payment\nnetwork security operating guidelines and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. We cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology\nsystems are able to prevent, contain or detect any cyber-attacks, cyber terrorism, or security breaches from known cyber-attacks or malware that may be developed in the future. To the extent that any\ncyber-attack or incursion in our or one of our third-party service provider's information systems results in the loss, damage or misappropriation of information, we may be materially adversely affected\nby claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and others. In certain circumstances, payment card association rules and obligations to which we are\nsubject under our contracts with payment card processors make us liable to payment card issuers if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we hold is\ncompromised, which liabilities could be substantial. In addition, the cost of complying with stricter and more complex data privacy, data collection and information security laws and standards could be\nsignificant to us.\nChanges\nin\nthe\nresults\nof\nour\nretail\npharmacy\nbusiness\ncould\nadversely\naffect\nour\noverall\nresults\nof\noperations,\ncash\nflows\nand\nliquidity.\nWalmart has retail pharmacy operations in our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments. A large majority of our retail pharmacy net sales are generated by filling prescriptions for which we receive\npayment through established contractual relationships with third-party payers and payment administrators, such as private insurers, governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers (\"PBMs\").\nOur retail pharmacy operations are subject to numerous risks, including: reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates for drugs; changes in our payer mix (i.e., shifts in the relative distribution of our\npharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorable reimbursement terms); changes in third party payer drug formularies (i.e., the schedule of\nprescription drugs approved for reimbursement or which otherwise receive preferential coverage treatment); growth in, and our participation in or exclusion from, exclusive and preferred pharmacy\nnetwork arrangements operated by PBMs and/or any insurance plan or program; increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription drugs we sell; increases in the administrative\nburdens associated with seeking third-party reimbursement; changes in the frequency with which new brand name pharmaceuticals become available to consumers; introduction of lower cost generic\ndrugs as substitutes for existing brand name drugs for which there was no prior generic drug competition; changes in drug mix (i.e., the relative distribution of drugs customers purchase at our\npharmacies between brands and generics); changes in the health insurance market generally; changes in the scope of or the elimination of Medicare Part D or Medicaid drug programs; increased\ncompetition from other retail pharmacy operations; further consolidation among third party payers, PBMs or purchasers of drugs; overall economic conditions and the ability of our pharmacy customers\nto pay for drugs prescribed for them to the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a third party; failure to meet any performance or incentive thresholds to which our level of third party reimbursement\nmay be subject; and changes in the regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry and the pharmaceutical industry, including as a result of restrictions on the further implementation of or the\nrepeal of\n19\nthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or the enactment and implementation of a law replacing such act, and other changes in laws, rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business.\nIf the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted for any reason, our pharmacy operations could be severely affected until at least such time as we\ncould obtain a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals. Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a significant number of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions\nto other pharmacies.\nOne or a combination of such factors may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell, our cost of sales associated with our retail pharmacy operations, and the net\nsales and gross margin of those operations or result in the loss of cross-store or cross-club selling opportunities and, in turn, adversely affect our overall net sales, other results of operations, cash flows\nand liquidity.\nOur\nfailure\nto\nattract\nand\nretain\nqualified\nassociates,\nincreases\nin\nwage\nand\nbenefit\ncosts,\nchanges\nin\nlaws\nand\nother\nlabor\nissues\ncould\nmaterially\nadversely\naffect\nour\nfinancial\nperformance.\nOur ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates globally. Our ability to meet our labor needs,\nincluding our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs and distribution centers, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is\ngenerally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate, unemployment levels within\nthose markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. If we are unable to locate, to\nattract or to retain qualified personnel, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented that further increase our\nlabor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.\nFinancial\nRisks\nFluctuations\nin\nforeign\nexchange\nrates\nmay\nmaterially\nadversely\naffect\nour\nfinancial\nperformance\nand\nour\nreported\nresults\nof\noperations.\nOur operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries. Our consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare\nthose financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars using\nexchange rates for the current period. In recent years, fluctuations in currency exchange rates that were unfavorable have had adverse effects on our reported results of operations.\nAs a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our consolidated financial statements reflecting significant\nadverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such\nfluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and\nhave a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations.\nWe may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold. When we must\nacquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling\nto change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may\nadversely affect our results of operations.\nFailure\nto\nmeet\nmarket\nexpectations\nfor\nour\nfinancial\nperformance\ncould\nadversely\naffect\nthe\nmarket\nprice\nand\nvolatility\nof\nour\nstock.\nWe believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our comparable\nstore and club sales growth rates, eCommerce growth rates, gross margin, or earnings and earnings per share could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or\nstock repurchase programs or policies. Additionally, failure of Walmart's performance to compare favorably to that of other retailers may have a negative effect on the price of our stock.\n20\nLegal,\nTax,\nRegulatory,\nCompliance,\nReputational\nand\nOther\nRisks\nOur\ninternational\noperations\nsubject\nus\nto\nlegislative,\njudicial,\naccounting,\nlegal,\nregulatory,\ntax,\npolitical\nand\neconomic\nrisks\nand\nconditions\nspecific\nto\nthe\ncountries\nor\nregions\nin\nwhich\nwe\noperate,\nwhich\ncould\nmaterially\nadversely\naffect\nour\nbusiness\nor\nfinancial\nperformance.\nIn addition to our U.S. operations, we operate our retail business in Africa, Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom.\nDuring fiscal 2019, our Walmart International operations generated approximately 24% of our consolidated net sales. Walmart International's operations in various countries also sources goods and\nservices from other countries. Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include political\nconditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints (such as regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory restrictions on\neCommerce offerings in international markets, such as India), restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures), local product safety and environmental laws, tax regulations, local\nlabor laws, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, currency regulations, laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection, and other matters in any of the countries or\nregions in which we operate, now or in the future.\nOur business and results of operations in the UK may be negatively affected by increases in food costs, changes in trade policies, changes in labor, immigration, tax or other laws and fluctuations in\ncurrency exchange rates resulting from the UK's pending exit from the European Union. We expect continued uncertainty around the extent of the impact of this exit on our business until the UK and the\nEuropean Union put in alternative trade and other arrangements.\nThe economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they occurred again, could adversely affect\nour financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other\nactivities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the U.S.\nAdditional risks inherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty\nin enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be\nexaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations.\nIn foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and\nregulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"), or the laws and regulations of other countries, such as the UK Bribery Act. We maintain a global policy prohibiting\nsuch business practices and have in place a global anti-corruption compliance program designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that\none or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries\nmay be customary, will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations,\neven if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation.\nChanges\nin\ntax\nand\ntrade\nlaws\nand\nregulations\ncould\nmaterially\nadversely\naffect\nour\nfinancial\nperformance.\nIn fiscal 2019, our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club operating segments generated approximately 76% of our consolidated net sales. The federal government has created the potential for significant changes\nin trade policies, including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we source many of the products we sell in our stores and clubs. Potential\nchanges which have been discussed include the renegotiation or termination of trade agreements and the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S. A significant portion of the general\nmerchandise we sell in our U.S. stores and clubs is manufactured in other countries. Any such actions could increase the cost to us of such merchandise (whether imported directly or indirectly) and\ncause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers, which could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our U.S. operations and our business.\nWe are subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. The determination of our worldwide provision\nfor income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. Our income taxes could be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in\njurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by\nchanges in worldwide tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles.\n21\nFor example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") significantly changed income tax laws that affect U.S. corporations and there are aspects of the Tax Act that remain unclear as additional\nguidance from the U.S. tax authority is pending. As further guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, any resulting changes in our estimates will be\ntreated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance.\nIn addition, we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and\nlegislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may\nmaterially affect our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which such determination and settlement is made.\nChanges\nin\nand/or\nfailure\nto\ncomply\nwith\nother\nlaws\nand\nregulations\nspecific\nto\nthe\nenvironments\nin\nwhich\nwe\noperate\ncould\nmaterially\nadversely\naffect\nour\nreputation,\nmarket\nposition,\nor\nour\nbusiness\nand\nfinancial\nperformance.\nWe operate in complex regulated environments in the United States and in the other countries in which we operate and could be adversely affected by changes to existing legal requirements including the\nrelated interpretations and enforcement practices, new legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicable regulations.\nOur pharmacy operations in the United States are subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations including licensing and other requirements for pharmacies and reimbursement arrangements.\nThe regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: federal and state registration and regulation of pharmacies; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing\npseudoephedrine; applicable governmental payer regulations including Medicare and Medicaid; data privacy and security laws and regulations including the Health Insurance Portability and\nAccountability Act, the Affordable Care Act, laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management\nand disposal of, hazardous substances; regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\") and the Drug Enforcement Administration (the\n\"DEA\"), trade regulations including those of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and consumer protection and safety regulations including those of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as\nstate regulatory authorities, governing the availability, sale, advertisement and promotion of products we sell and the financial services we offer; anti-kickback laws; false claims laws; and federal and\nstate laws governing health care fraud and abuse and the practice of the professions of pharmacy, optical care and nurse practitioner services.\nFor example, in the United States the DEA and various other regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. We are required to hold valid\nDEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale, dispensing,\ndisposal and holding of controlled substances. The DEA, the FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant\ncriminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations.\nWe are also governed by foreign, national and state laws and regulations of general applicability, including laws and regulations related to working conditions, health and safety, equal employment\nopportunity, employee benefit and other labor and employment matters, laws and regulations related to competition, and antitrust matters, and health and wellness related regulations for our pharmacy\noperations outside of the United States. In addition, certain financial services we offer or make available, such as our money transfer agent services, are subject to legal and regulatory requirements,\nincluding those intended to help detect and prevent money laundering, fraud and other illicit activity. The impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and changes in\nenforcement practices or regulatory scrutiny generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require\nextensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or\nservices we offer.\nUntimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our\nbusinesses, including: suspension of payments from government programs; loss of required government certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs,\nincluding the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the United States; loss of licenses; and significant fines or monetary damages and/or penalties. In addition, failure to comply with applicable legal or\nregulatory requirements in the United States or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and have a material adverse\neffect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe\nare\nsubject\nto\ncertain\nlegal\nproceedings\nthat\nmay\nmaterially\nadversely\naffect\nour\nresults\nof\noperations,\nfinancial\ncondition\nand\nliquidity.\nWe are involved in a number of legal proceedings, which include consumer, employment, tort and other litigation. In particular, we are currently a defendant in a number of cases containing class-action\nallegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws, as well as a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought\nclaims under federal and state consumer laws.\n22\nIn addition, ASDA Stores, Ltd. (\"Asda\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has been named as a defendant in numerous \"equal value\" claims pending in the Manchester Employment Tribunal\n(the \"Employment Tribunal\") in the United Kingdom. The claimants, who are current and former Asda store employees, allege that the work performed by female employees in Asda's retail stores is of\nequal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs to that of male employees working in Asda's warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the disparity in pay between these\ndifferent job positions is not objectively justified. The claimants are seeking differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouses and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a\nprospective basis. At present, we cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters . In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities,\nhealthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payors, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation\nis entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) , and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of\nthe cases included in this multidistrict litigation. Similar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, health care providers and other plaintiffs.\nPlaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot\nreasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from such claims.\nWe discuss these cases and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption \" Item 3. Legal Proceedings \" and in Note 10 in the \" Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements ,\" which\nare part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe\ncould\nbe\nsubject\nto\nliability,\npenalties\nand\nother\nsanctions\nand\nother\nadverse\nconsequences\narising\nout\nof\nour\non-going\nFCPA\nmatter.\nAs previously disclosed, we are under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (the \"DOJ\") and the SEC regarding possible violations of the FCPA. We have been cooperating with those agencies\nand discussions have been ongoing with them regarding the resolution of these matters. These discussions have progressed to a point that in fiscal 2018, we reasonably estimated a probable loss and\nrecorded an aggregate accrual of $283 million with respect to these matters (the \"Accrual\").\nA number of federal and local government agencies in Mexico also investigated these matters. Walmex cooperated with the Mexican governmental agencies that conducted these investigations.\nFurthermore, lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation were filed by several of our shareholders against us, certain of our current and former directors and former officers and certain of\nWalmex's former officers. These matters have been resolved or immaterial accruals have been made for proposed settlements.\nWe could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of the matters noted above. One or more enforcement actions could be instituted in respect of the matters that are the subject of\nsome or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, debarment or other relief,\ncriminal convictions and/or penalties. Shareholder lawsuits may result in judgments against us and our current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings. We also expect that there\nwill be ongoing media and governmental interest regarding these matters, including additional news articles on these matters that could impact the perception among certain audiences of our role as a\ncorporate citizen. Moreover, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimony and other information in\nconnection with the government investigations, in defending the shareholder lawsuits and with respect to investigations.\nWhile we have made an Accrual for these matters, because the discussions are continuing, there can be no assurance as to the timing or the terms of the final resolution of these matters. Although we do\nnot presently believe that these matters, including the Accrual (and the payment of the Accrual at some point-in-time in the future) will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position,\nresults of operations or cash flows, given the inherent uncertainties in such situations, we can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to our business, financial position, results of\noperations or cash flows in the future.",

See \"Item 1. Business\" above for additional discussion of the competitive situation of each of our reportable segments.\nCertain segments of the retail industry are undergoing consolidation, which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail\nmarketplace. Other segments are substantially reducing operations which could also result in competition rushing to fill the void created by such corporate actions.\nSuch consolidation, or other business combinations or alliances, or reduction in operation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources,\nimproved access to merchandise, greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions. Such business\ncombinations or alliances could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated or aligned companies,\nwhich could adversely affect our financial performance.\nIf we do not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, it could negatively affect our relationship with our customers,\ndemand for the products and services we sell, our market share and the growth of our business.\nIt is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their shopping patterns. The success of\nour business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products\nand the competitive environment. Price transparency, assortment of products, customer experience, convenience, ease and the speed and cost of shipping are of\nprimary importance to customers and continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the\nchoices available to consumers for purchasing products. Our failure to adequately or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping\npatterns, or any other failure on our part to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns could negatively\naffect our relationship with our customers, the demand for the products we sell or services we offer, our market share and the growth of our business.\nFailure to successfully execute our omni-channel strategy and the cost of our investments in eCommerce and technology may materially adversely affect\nour market position, net sales and financial performance.\nThe retail business continues to rapidly evolve and consumers increasingly embrace digital shopping. As a result, the portion of total consumer expenditures with\nretailers and wholesale clubs occurring through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase could accelerate.\nOur strategy, which includes investments in eCommerce, technology, acquisitions, joint ventures, store remodels and other customer initiatives may not adequately\nor effectively allow us to grow our eCommerce business, increase comparable store sales, maintain or grow our overall market position or otherwise offset the\nimpact on the growth of our business of a moderated pace of new store and club openings. The success of this strategy will depend in large measure on our ability\nto continue building and delivering a seamless omni-channel shopping experience for our customers and is further subject to the related risks discussed in this Item\n1A. Failure to successfully execute this strategy may adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance which could also result in\nimpairment charges to intangible assets or other long-lived assets. In addition, a greater concentration of eCommerce sales, including increasing online grocery\nsales, could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-store or cross-club sales of\nmerchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nFurthermore, the cost of certain eCommerce and technology investments, including any operating losses incurred, will adversely impact our financial performance\nin the short-term and failure to realize the benefits of these investments may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term.\nThe performance of strategic alliances and other business relationships to support the expansion of our business could materially adversely affect our\nfinancial performance.\nWe may enter into strategic alliances and other business relationships in the countries in which we have existing operations or in other markets to expand our retail\noperations. These arrangements may not generate the level of sales we anticipate when entering into the arrangement or may otherwise adversely impact our\nbusiness and competitive position relative to the results we could have achieved in the absence of such alliance. In addition, any investment we make in connection\nwith a strategic alliance or business relationship could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n15\nOperational Risks\nNatural disasters, changes in climate, and geo-political events and catastrophic events could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, typhoons; weather conditions\nsuch as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise; severe changes in climate; geo-political\nevents; global health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks such as the recent coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak; and catastrophic events, such as\nwar, civil unrest, terrorist attacks or other acts of violence, including active shooter situations (such as those that have occurred in our U.S. stores), in countries in\nwhich we operate or in which our suppliers are located, could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.\nSuch events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution\nfacilities, limitations on store or club operating hours, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and associates to reach or have\ntransportation to our stores and clubs affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution facilities are\nlocated, the unavailability of our digital platforms to our customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers (including the frequency of visits by\nconsumers to physical retail locations, whether as a result of limitations on large gatherings, travel and movement limitations or otherwise) and in consumers'\ndisposable income, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the\ndisruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution facilities or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of\nproducts in our stores, the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities, and the disruption in our communications with our stores. For example, our\nresults for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 were negatively impacted by riots and looting in Chile which resulted in us closing a number of our stores until the\ndisruption abated.\nWe bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to, or destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory and\nbusiness interruption caused by such events. These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which they\noccur and could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nRisks associated with our suppliers could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important\nfactor in our financial performance. We expect our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety, anti-corruption and environmental laws, and\nto otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards, and to access products in a timely\nand efficient manner, is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the U.S.\nPolitical and economic instability, as well as other impactful events and circumstances in the countries in which our suppliers and their manufacturers are located\n(such as the recent coronavirus outbreak which could result in potential disruptions or delays to our global supply chain), the financial instability of suppliers,\nsuppliers' failure to meet our terms and conditions or our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our\nsuppliers and their manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption or delay in the transportation of\nmerchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material\namount of merchandise we purchase enters into the markets in which we operate, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security,\ninflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the U.S. foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the\nimportation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our\ncontrol. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance.\nIf the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers' expectations, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries suffered\nby customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise experience a material impact to our brand, reputation and financial performance. We\nare also subject to reputational and other risks related to third-party sales on our digital platforms.\nOur customers count on us to provide them with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers or\nthat we prepare and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and\nnon-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to\nreestablish and such products also expose us to product liability or food safety claims. As such, any issue regarding the safety of any food or non-food items we\nsell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our brand, reputation and financial performance. In addition,\n16\nthird-parties sell goods on some of our digital platforms, which we refer to as marketplace transactions. Whether laws related to such sales apply to us is currently\nunsettled and any unfavorable changes could expose us to loss of sales, reduction in transactions and deterioration of our competitive position. In addition, we may\nface reputational, financial and other risks, including liability, for third-party sales of goods that are controversial, counterfeit or otherwise fail to comply with\napplicable law. Although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to detect,\nenforce, or collect sufficient damages for breaches of such agreements. Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of\noperations and impede the execution of our eCommerce growth strategy.\nWe rely extensively on information systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Disruptions in our systems could harm\nour ability to conduct our operations.\nGiven the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is crucial that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical information systems.\nOur information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other\nmalicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches (through cyber-attacks from cyber-attackers and sophisticated organizations including\nnation states), catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our associates or contractors. Our information systems\nare essential to our business operations, including the processing of transactions, management of our associates, facilities, logistics, inventories, physical stores and\nclubs and our online operations. Our information systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. If our\nsystems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and may experience loss or\ncorruption of critical data as well as suffer interruptions in our business operations in the interim. Any interruption to our information systems may have a material\nadverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we are constantly updating our information technology processes and systems. The risk of\nsystem disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken. If we fail to timely integrate and update our information systems and processes, we\nmay fail to realize the cost savings or operational benefits anticipated to be derived from these initiatives.\nIf the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our\nability to grow our omni-channel business globally, could be materially adversely affected.\nIncreasingly, customers are using computers, tablets, and smart phones to shop with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping. We use social\nmedia, online advertising, and email to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. As a part of our omni-channel sales\nstrategy, in addition to home delivery, we offer various pickup and delivery programs under which many products available for purchase online can be picked up\nby the customer or member at a local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs. Omni-channel retailing is a\nrapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations around the world. We must anticipate and meet our customers' changing expectations while\nadjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors' operations through focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping\nexperience across all channels by each operating segment. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, user-friendly secure digital platforms that offer a wide\nassortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online\nshoppers and developments in online and digital platform merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of\neCommerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our eCommerce business globally and have a\nmaterial adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nOur digital platforms, which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope, and the systems on which they run,\nincluding those applications and systems in our acquired eCommerce businesses, are regularly subject to cyber-attacks. Those attacks involve attempts to gain\nunauthorized access to our eCommerce websites (including marketplace platforms) or mobile commerce applications to obtain and misuse customers' or members'\ninformation including payment information and related risks discussed in this Item 1A. Such attacks, if successful, in addition to potential data misuse, may also\ncreate denials of service or otherwise disable, degrade or sabotage one or more of our digital platforms or otherwise significantly disrupt our customers' and\nmembers' shopping experience. If we are unable to maintain the security of our digital platforms and keep them operating within acceptable parameters, we could\nsuffer loss of sales, reductions in transactions, reputational damage and deterioration of our competitive position and incur liability for any damage to customers or\nothers whose personal or confidential information is unlawfully obtained and misused, any of which events could have a material adverse impact on our business\nand results of operations and impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our business.\n17\nAny failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our company, customers, members, associates and vendors, whether as a result of\ncybersecurity attacks on our information systems or otherwise, could damage our reputation, result in litigation or other legal actions against us, cause us\nto incur substantial additional costs, and materially adversely affect our business and operating results.\nLike most retailers, we receive and store in our information systems personal information about our customers and members, and we receive and store personal\ninformation concerning our associates and vendors. Some of that information is stored digitally in connection with our digital platforms. We also utilize third-party\nservice providers for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, for digital storage technology, content delivery to customers and members, back-office\nsupport, and other functions. Such providers may have access to information we hold about our customers, members, associates or vendors. In addition, our\neCommerce operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments.\nCyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly\nsophisticated. Cyber threats and cyber-attackers can be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of hackers with a wide range\nof motives and expertise. We and the businesses with which we interact have experienced and continue to experience threats to data and systems, including by\nperpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyber-attacks, computer viruses, worms, bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to\nmisappropriate customer information, including credit card information, and cause system failures and disruptions. Some of our systems have experienced limited\nsecurity breaches and although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future.\nAssociate error or malfeasance, faulty password management, social engineering or other irregularities may also result in a defeat of our or our third-party service\nproviders' security measures and a breach of our or their information systems. Moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may have inherent\nvulnerabilities or defects of design, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise\ninformation security.\nAny compromise of our data security systems or of those of businesses with which we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed, obtained,\ndamaged, modified, lost or used by unauthorized or improper persons, could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions, customer attrition,\nremediation expenses, and claims from customers, members, associates, vendors, financial institutions, payment card networks and other persons, any of which\ncould materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized\naccess, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of a compromise, we may be unable to anticipate\nthese techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures and we or our third-party service providers may not discover any security breach, vulnerability or\ncompromise of information for a significant period of time after the security incident occurs.\nIn addition, such events could be widely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, members, associates, vendors and\nshareholders, could harm our competitive position particularly with respect to our eCommerce operations, and could result in a material reduction in our net sales\nin our eCommerce operations, as well as in our stores thereby materially adversely affecting our operations, net sales, results of operations, financial condition,\ncash flows and liquidity. Such events could also result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and financial condition and\nperformance and could result in litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by our\ninsurance policies. Moreover, a security compromise could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the issue and\nto expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to guard personal and confidential information against cyber-attacks\nand other attempts to access or otherwise compromise such information and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our digital operations.\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, and our private label credit cards and gift cards, and we may offer\nnew payment options over time, which may have information security risk implications. As a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject\nto various industry data protection standards and protocols, such as payment network security operating guidelines and the Payment Card Industry Data Security\nStandard. We cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent, contain or detect\ncyber-attacks, cyber terrorism, security breaches or other compromises from known malware or other threats that may be developed in the future. To the extent that\nany cyber-attack or incursion in our or one of our third-party service provider's information systems results in the loss, damage, misappropriation or other\ncompromise of information, we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card\nnetworks and others. In certain circumstances, our contracts with payment card processors and payment card networks (such as Visa, Mastercard, American\nExpress and Discover) generally require us to adhere to payment card network rules which could make us liable to payment card issuers and others if information\nin connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we process is compromised, which liabilities could be substantial.\n18\nAdditionally, we offer money (wire) transfer services, digital payment platforms, bill payment, money orders and check cashing and we sell prepaid cards and gift\ncards. We further offer co-branded credit cards and installment loans through financial services partners. These products and services require us to comply with\nlegal and regulatory requirements, including global anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and regulations as well as international, federal and state consumer\nfinancial laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, sanctions, penalties and harm to our reputation.\nThe Company also has compliance obligations associated with new privacy laws enacted to protect personal information. The California Consumer Privacy Act of\n2018, (CCPA), grants California consumers certain rights over their personal information and imposes stringent requirements on the collection, use and sharing of\n“personal information” of California consumers. Other U.S. states are proposing similar laws related to the protection of personal information and the U.S. federal\ngovernment is also considering federal privacy legislation. Outside the U.S., the European Union’s (“EU”) General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) greatly\nincreases the jurisdictional reach of EU law and adds a broad array of requirements related to personal data. Complying with changing regulatory requirements\nrequires us to incur additional costs and expenses. If we fail to comply with CCPA, GDPR or other privacy related regulations, or if regulators assert we have failed\nto comply with them, it could lead to regulatory enforcement action, monetary fines or penalties (up to 4% of worldwide revenue in the case of GDPR), lawsuits or\nreputational damage and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nChanges in the results of our retail pharmacy business could adversely affect our overall results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nWalmart has retail pharmacy operations in our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments, as well as the recent addition of Walmart Health Centers to some of our\nU.S. stores. A large majority of our retail pharmacy net sales are generated by filling prescriptions for which we receive payment through established contractual\nrelationships with third-party payers and payment administrators, such as private insurers, governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers (\"PBMs\").\nOur retail pharmacy operations are subject to numerous risks, including: reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates for drugs; changes in our payer mix (i.e.,\nshifts in the relative distribution of our pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorable\nreimbursement terms); changes in third-party payer drug formularies (i.e., the schedule of prescription drugs approved for reimbursement or which otherwise\nreceive preferential coverage treatment); growth in, and our participation in or exclusion from, exclusive and preferred pharmacy network arrangements operated\nby PBMs and/or any insurance plan or program; increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription drugs we sell; increases in the\nadministrative burdens associated with seeking third-party reimbursement; changes in the frequency with which new brand name pharmaceuticals become\navailable to consumers; introduction of lower cost generic drugs as substitutes for existing brand name drugs for which there was no prior generic drug\ncompetition; changes in drug mix (i.e., the relative distribution of drugs customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands and generics); changes in the health\ninsurance market generally; changes in the scope of or the elimination of Medicare Part D or Medicaid drug programs; increased competition from other retail\npharmacy operations; further consolidation and strategic alliances among third-party payers, PBMs or purchasers of drugs; overall economic conditions and the\nability of our pharmacy customers to pay for drugs prescribed for them to the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a third-party; failure to meet any performance\nor incentive thresholds to which our level of third-party reimbursement may be subject; and changes in the regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry\nand the pharmaceutical industry, including as a result of restrictions on the further implementation of or the repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care\nAct or the enactment and implementation of a law replacing such act, and other changes in laws, rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business.\nIf the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted for any reason, our pharmacy operations could be severely\naffected until at least such time as we could obtain a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals. Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a\nsignificant number of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies.\nOne or a combination of such factors may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell, our cost of sales associated with our\nretail pharmacy operations, and the net sales and gross margin of those operations or result in the loss of cross-store or cross-club selling opportunities and, in turn,\nadversely affect our overall net sales, other results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nOur failure to attract and retain qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other labor issues could materially\nadversely affect our financial performance.\nOur ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates\nglobally. Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs,\ndistribution centers and corporate offices, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including\nthe availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate, unemployment levels within those markets,\nprevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised\n19\nemployment and labor laws and regulations. Additionally, our ability to successfully execute organizational changes, including management transitions within the\nCompany's senior leadership, such as our recent leadership changes, and to effectively motivate and retain associates are critical to our business success. If we are\nunable to locate, attract or retain qualified personnel, or manage leadership transition successfully, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease\nand our financial performance may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or\nimplemented that further increase our labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.\nFinancial Risks\nFluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations.\nOur operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries. Our consolidated financial statements are\ndenominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expenses\nof our operations outside of the U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. In recent years, fluctuations in currency\nexchange rates that were unfavorable have had adverse effects on our reported results of operations.\nAs a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our consolidated\nfinancial statements reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in our\nfinancial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable currency exchange rate\nfluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our\nreported consolidated results of operations.\nWe may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the\ngoods will be sold. When we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable\nto us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with\na corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates have and may continue to adversely affect\nour results of operations.\nFailure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.\nWe believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these\nexpectations, including our comparable store and club sales growth rates, eCommerce growth rates, gross margin, or earnings and earnings per share could cause\nthe market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies. Additionally, failure of Walmart's performance\nto compare favorably to that of other retailers may have a negative effect on the price of our stock.\nLegal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks\nOur international operations subject us to legislative, judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the\ncountries or regions in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance.\nIn addition to our U.S. operations, we operate our retail business in Africa, Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the United\nKingdom.\nDuring fiscal 2020, our Walmart International operations generated approximately 23% of our consolidated net sales. Walmart International's operations in various\ncountries also source goods and services from other countries. Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors,\nmost of which are beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions, legal and\nregulatory constraints (such as regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory restrictions (such as foreign ownership restrictions) on eCommerce\nand retail operations in international markets, such as India), restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures), local product safety and\nenvironmental laws, tax regulations, local labor laws, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, currency regulations, laws and regulations\nregarding consumer and data protection, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future.\nFor example, during the current transition period following the UK’s recent exit from the European Union, we face continued uncertainty regarding the impact on\nour UK business of potential changes in tariffs, trade practices and other regulations while the UK and EU work to put in place alternative trade and other\narrangements.\n20\nThe economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they\noccurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and\nfiscal policies of the U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks\nassociated with having numerous facilities located in countries that have historically been less stable than the U.S.. Additional risks inherent in our international\noperations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in\nenforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S.. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing\nbusiness outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and\nregulations.\nIn foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business\npractices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"), or the laws and regulations of other\ncountries, such as the UK Bribery Act. We maintain a global policy prohibiting such business practices and have in place a global anti-corruption compliance\nprogram designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors\nor agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may\nbe customary, will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and\nregulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation.\nChanges in tax and trade laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nIn fiscal 2020, our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club operating segments generated approximately 77% of our consolidated net sales. The federal government has\ncreated the potential for significant changes in trade policies, including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries\nwhere we source many of the products we sell in our stores and clubs. Potential changes which have been discussed include the renegotiation or termination of\ntrade agreements and the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S. A significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our U.S. stores and clubs\nis manufactured in other countries. Any such actions including the imposition of further tariffs on imports could increase the cost to us of such merchandise\n(whether imported directly or indirectly) and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers, which could materially adversely\naffect the financial performance of our U.S. operations and our business.\nWe are subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. The\ndetermination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. Our income taxes\ncould be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in\njurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in worldwide tax laws, tax\nrates, regulations or accounting principles.\nFor example, in December 2019, India enacted a bill which significantly reduced the corporate income tax for certain companies with operations in India. In the\nU.S., the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") significantly changed income tax laws that affect U.S. corporations with additional guidance from the U.S.\ntax authority still pending. As further guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, any resulting changes in our\nestimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. Compliance with the Tax Act, including collecting information not regularly\nproduced by the Company or unexpected changes in our estimates, may require us to incur additional costs and could affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of\nchanging tax regulations and legislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax\namounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods\nfor which such determination and settlement is made.\n21\nChanges in and/or failure to comply with other laws and regulations specific to the environments in which we operate could materially adversely affect\nour reputation, market position, or our business and financial performance.\nWe operate in complex regulated environments in the U.S. and in the other countries in which we operate and could be adversely affected by changes to existing\nlegal requirements including the related interpretations and enforcement practices, new legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicable regulations.\nOur pharmacy and other healthcare operations in the U.S. are subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations including licensing and other requirements\nand reimbursement arrangements. The regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: federal and state registration and regulation of\npharmacies; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; applicable governmental payer regulations including Medicare\nand Medicaid; data privacy and security laws and regulations including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the Affordable Care Act, laws and\nregulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of,\nhazardous substances; regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\") and the Drug\nEnforcement Administration (the \"DEA\"), trade regulations including those of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and consumer protection and safety regulations\nincluding those of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the availability, sale, advertisement and promotion\nof products we sell and the financial services we offer; anti-kickback laws; false claims laws; and federal and state laws governing health care fraud and abuse and\nthe practice of the professions of pharmacy, optical care and nurse practitioner services.\nFor example, in the U.S. the DEA and various other regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances.\nWe are required to hold valid DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state controlled\nsubstance acts and related regulations governing the sale, dispensing, disposal and holding of controlled substances. The DEA, the FDA and state regulatory\nauthorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for\nviolations of these laws and regulations.\nWe are also governed by foreign, national and state laws and regulations of general applicability, including laws and regulations related to working conditions,\nhealth and safety, equal employment opportunity, employee benefit and other labor and employment matters, laws and regulations related to competition, and\nantitrust matters, and health and wellness related regulations for our pharmacy operations outside of the U.S. In addition, certain financial services we offer or\nmake available, such as our money transfer agent services, are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, including those intended to help detect and prevent\nmoney laundering, sanctions, fraud and other illicit activity as well as consumer financial protection. The impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the\nrelated interpretations, as well as changes in enforcement practices or regulatory scrutiny generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations\nand policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our\noperating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services we offer.\nUntimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely\naffect the continued operation of our businesses, including: suspension of payments from government programs; loss of required government certifications; loss of\nauthorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the U.S.; loss of licenses; and\nsignificant fines or monetary damages and/or penalties. In addition, failure to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements in the U.S. or in any of the\ncountries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business\noperations, financial condition and results of operations.\n22\nWe are subject to certain legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe are involved in a number of legal proceedings, which include consumer, employment, tort and other litigation. In particular, we are currently a defendant in a\nnumber of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws, as well as a number of\ncases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws.\nIn addition, ASDA Stores, Ltd. (\"Asda\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has been named as a defendant in numerous \"equal value\" claims pending in\nthe Manchester Employment Tribunal (the \"Employment Tribunal\") in the United Kingdom. The claimants, who are current and former Asda store employees,\nallege that the work performed by employees in Asda's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs to that of employees\nworking in Asda's warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the difference in pay between these job positions disparately impacts women because more\nwomen work in retail stores while more men work in warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the pay difference is not objectively justified. The claimants\nare seeking differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouses and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis. At present, we cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters. The Company has been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance\ndispensing and distribution practices involving opioids and is also a defendant in numerous litigation proceedings related to opioids including the consolidated\nmultidistrict litigation entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804), currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District\nof Ohio. Similar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, health care providers and other plaintiffs.\nPlaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims\nthat may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from such claims and the related opioid matters.\nWe discuss these cases and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings\" and in Note 10 in the \"Notes to our\nConsolidated Financial Statements,\" which are part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions\nand proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could limit our shareholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes\nwith us or our directors, officers, employees or shareholders in such capacity.\nOur bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest\nextent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for claims, including derivative claims that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former\ndirector, officer, employee or shareholder in such capacity or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery.\nThis exclusive forum provision may limit a shareholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the shareholder finds favorable for disputes with us or our\ndirectors, officers, employees or shareholders in such capacity, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to\nfind these provisions of our bylaws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, the claims as to which they are intended to apply, then we may incur additional\ncosts associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.",

      "item1a":"Strategic Risks\nFailure to successfully execute our omni-channel strategy and the cost of our investments in eCommerce and technology may materially adversely affect\nour market position, net sales and financial performance.\nThe retail business continues to rapidly evolve and consumers increasingly embrace digital shopping. As a result, the portion of total consumer expenditures with\nretailers and wholesale clubs occurring through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase could continue to accelerate.\nOur strategy, which includes investments in eCommerce, technology, acquisitions, joint ventures, store remodels and other customer initiatives, may not\nadequately or effectively allow us to continue to grow our eCommerce business, increase comparable store sales, maintain or grow our overall market position or\notherwise offset the impact on the growth of our business of a moderated pace of new store and club openings. The success of this strategy will depend in large\nmeasure on our ability to continue building and delivering a seamless omni-channel shopping experience for our customers and is further subject to the related\nrisks discussed in this Item 1A. Failure to successfully execute this strategy may adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance which\ncould also result in impairment charges to intangible assets or other long-lived assets. In addition, a greater concentration of eCommerce sales, including increasing\nonline grocery sales, could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-store or\ncross-club sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect our financial\nperformance.\nFurthermore, the cost of certain eCommerce and technology investments, including any operating losses incurred, will adversely impact our financial performance\nin the short-term and failure to realize the benefits of these investments may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term.\nIf we do not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, it could negatively affect our relationship with our customers,\ndemand for the products and services we sell, our market share and the growth of our business.\nIt is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their shopping patterns. The success of\nour business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products\nand the competitive environment. Price transparency, assortment of products, customer experience, convenience, ease and the speed and cost of shipping are of\nprimary importance to customers and continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the\nchoices available to consumers for purchasing products. Our failure to adequately or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (including those\nrelated to sustainability) and shopping patterns, or any other failure on our part to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences\nand shopping patterns could negatively affect our reputation and relationship with our customers, the demand for the products we sell or services we offer, our\nmarket share and the growth of our business.\n14\nWe face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nEach of our segments competes for customers, employees, digital prominence, products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other\nlocal, regional, national and global physical, eCommerce and omni-channel retailers, wholesale club operators and retail intermediaries.\nWe compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers,\nlocation, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital\nplatforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integration\nof our physical and digital operations.\nA failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets or delays or failure in execution of our strategy could materially\nadversely affect our financial performance. See \"Item 1. Business\" above for additional discussion of the competitive situation of each of our reportable segments.\nCertain segments of the retail industry are undergoing consolidation or substantially reducing operations, whether due to bankruptcy, consolidation or other factors.\nSuch consolidation, or other business combinations or alliances, or reduction in operation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources,\nimproved access to merchandise, greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions. Such business\ncombinations or alliances could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated or aligned companies,\nwhich could adversely affect our financial performance.\nGeneral or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nGeneral economic conditions and other economic factors, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance.\nHigher interest rates, lower or higher prices of petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel, higher costs for electricity and other\nenergy, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, increased costs of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of\nunemployment, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes in consumer spending and\nshopping patterns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes or other changes in tax laws, changes in healthcare laws, other\nregulatory changes, the imposition of tariffs or other measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, overall economic\nslowdown or recession and other economic factors in the U.S. or in any of the other markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer demand for the\nproducts we sell in the U.S. or such other markets, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary\npurchases of goods, adversely affect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory, or otherwise materially adversely\naffect our operations and operating results and could result in impairment charges to intangible assets, goodwill or other long-lived assets.\nIn addition, the economic factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation, labor, insurance or healthcare costs\nor commodity prices, and other economic factors in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general\nand administrative expenses and otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results.\nThe economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers, which can result in an increase in the cost to us of the\ngoods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale.\nThe performance of strategic alliances and other business relationships to support the expansion of our business could materially adversely affect our\nfinancial performance.\nWe may enter into strategic alliances and other business relationships in the countries in which we have existing operations or in other markets to expand our\nbusiness. These arrangements may not generate the level of sales we anticipate when entering into the arrangement or may otherwise adversely impact our business\nand competitive position relative to the results we could have achieved in the absence of such alliance. In addition, any investment we make in connection with a\nstrategic alliance, business relationship or in certain of our recently divested markets, could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n15\nOperational Risks\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial position and results of operations is in many respects unpredictable, and we may be\nunable to sustain our revenue growth rate in the future.\nThe continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are highly unpredictable and volatile, with varying impacts on certain business operations, demand for our\nproducts and services, in-stock positions, costs of doing business, access to inventory, supply chain operations, our ability to predict future performance, exposure\nto litigation, and our financial performance, among other things.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in widespread and continuing impacts on the global economy and on our domestic and international associates, members,\nsuppliers and other people and entities with which we do business. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which COVID-19 will continue to\nspread and the extent and duration of measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business and\ngovernment shutdowns and other restrictions on retailers.\nCustomer demand for certain products has also fluctuated as the pandemic has progressed and customer behaviors have changed, which has challenged our ability\nto anticipate and/or adjust inventory levels to meet that demand. These factors have resulted in higher out-of-stock positions in certain products, as well as delays\nin delivering those products, and could impact inventory levels in the future.\nOther factors and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the severity and duration of the pandemic, including whether there are additional outbreaks or spikes\nin the number of COVID-19 cases, future mutations or related strains of the virus in areas in which we operate; further increased operational costs associated with\noperating during a global pandemic; evolving macroeconomic factors, including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates, and recessionary pressures;\nunknown consequences on our business performance and initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time, capital and other resources to the pandemic\nresponse; the availability of, and prevalence of access to, effective medical treatments and vaccines for COVID-19; the pace of recovery when the pandemic\nsubsides; and the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including consumer behaviors. These risks and their impacts are difficult to\npredict and could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and our financial performance.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased revenue growth relative to historic trends, and has particularly accelerated our eCommerce growth. These results, as\nwell as those of other metrics such as net income and other financial and operating data, may not be indicative of results for future periods. Once the impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic subsides, particularly as vaccines become more widely available, and customers return to work or school or are otherwise no longer subject\nto the aforementioned containment directives and similar mandates, a failure by us to continue capitalizing on growth opportunities may result in declining revenue\nand future operating results may fall below expectations.\nTo the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect the U.S. and the global economy, it may also heighten other risks described in this\nsection, including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and expectations, competition, our reputation, implementation of strategic initiatives,\ncybersecurity threats, payment-related risks, technology systems disruption, supply chain disruptions, labor availability and cost, litigation, and regulatory\nrequirements.\nNatural disasters, climate change, geopolitical events, global health epidemics or pandemics and catastrophic events could materially adversely affect our\nfinancial performance.\nThe occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, typhoons; weather conditions\nsuch as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise; geopolitical events; global health epidemics\nor pandemics or other contagious outbreaks such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; and catastrophic events, such as war, civil unrest, terrorist attacks or other\nacts of violence, including active shooter situations (such as those that have occurred in our U.S. stores), in countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers\nare located, could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.\nSuch events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution or\nfulfillment centers, limitations on store or club operating hours, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and associates to reach or\nhave transportation to our stores and clubs affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution and\nfulfillment centers are located, the unavailability of our digital platforms to our customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers (including the\nfrequency of visits by consumers to physical retail locations, whether as a result of limitations on large gatherings, travel and movement limitations or otherwise)\nand in consumers' disposable income, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods\nfrom overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution and fulfillment centers or stores within a country in which we are operating, the\nreduction in the availability of products in our stores, the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities, and the disruption in our communications\nwith our stores.\n16\nFurthermore, the long-term impacts of climate change, whether involving physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions or rising sea levels) or transition risks\n(such as regulatory or technology changes) are expected to be widespread and unpredictable. These changes over time could affect, for example, the availability\nand cost of certain consumer products, commodities and energy (including utilities), which in turn may impact our ability to procure those certain goods or services\nrequired for the operation of our business at the quantities and levels we require.\nWe bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to, or destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers, loss or spoilage of\ninventory and business interruption caused by such events. These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas\nin which they occur and could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nRisks associated with our suppliers could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important\nfactor in our financial performance. We expect our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety, anti-corruption and environmental laws, and\nto otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards, and to access products in a timely\nand efficient manner and in the large volumes we may demand, is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the\nU.S.\nPolitical and economic instability, as well as other impactful events and circumstances in the countries in which our suppliers and their manufacturers are located\n(such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet our terms and conditions or our supplier standards\n(including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers,\nmerchandise safety and quality issues, disruption or delay in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs, and other\nfacilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the markets in which we operate,\ncurrency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are\nlocated are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the U.S. foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries and entities, the limitation\non the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our\ncontrol. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance.\nIf the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers' expectations, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries suffered\nby customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise experience a material impact to our brand, reputation and financial performance. We\nare also subject to reputational and other risks related to third-party sales on our digital platforms.\nOur customers count on us to provide them with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers or\nthat we prepare and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and\nnon-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to\nreestablish and such products also expose us to product liability or food safety claims. As such, any issue regarding the safety of any food or non-food items we\nsell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our brand, reputation and financial performance. In addition, third-parties sell goods on some of our digital\nplatforms, which we refer to as marketplace transactions. Whether laws related to such sales apply to us is currently unsettled and any unfavorable changes could\nexpose us to loss of sales, reduction in transactions and deterioration of our competitive position. In addition, we may face reputational, financial and other risks,\nincluding liability, for third-party sales of goods that are controversial, counterfeit or otherwise fail to comply with applicable law. Although we impose contractual\nterms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to detect, enforce, or collect sufficient damages for breaches of\nsuch agreements. Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our eCommerce\ngrowth strategy.\nWe rely extensively on information systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Disruptions in our systems could harm\nour ability to conduct our operations.\nGiven the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is crucial that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical information systems.\nOur information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other\nmalicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches (through cyberattacks from cyberattackers and sophisticated organizations including\nnation states), catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our associates or contractors. Our information systems\nare essential to our business operations, including the processing of transactions, management of our associates, facilities, logistics, inventories, physical stores and\nclubs and our online operations. Our information systems are not\n17\nfully redundant and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. If our systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly, we may\nhave to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and may experience loss or corruption of critical data as well as suffer interruptions in our business\noperations in the interim. Any interruption to our information systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we\nare constantly updating our information technology processes and systems. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are\nundertaken. If we fail to timely integrate and update our information systems and processes, we may fail to realize the cost savings or operational benefits\nanticipated to be derived from these initiatives.\nIf the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our\nability to grow our omni-channel business globally, could be materially adversely affected.\nIncreasingly, customers are using computers, tablets, and smart phones to shop with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping. We use social\nmedia, online advertising, and email to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. As a part of our omni-channel sales\nstrategy, we offer various pickup, delivery and shipping programs including options where many products available for purchase online can be picked up by the\ncustomer or member at a local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs. Omni-channel retailing is a\nrapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations around the world. We must anticipate and meet our customers' changing expectations while\nadjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors' operations through focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping\nexperience across all channels by each operating segment. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, user-friendly secure digital platforms that offer a wide\nassortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online\nshoppers and developments in online and digital platform merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of\neCommerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our eCommerce business globally and have a\nmaterial adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nOur digital platforms, which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope, and the systems on which they run,\nincluding those applications and systems in our acquired eCommerce businesses, are regularly subject to cyberattacks. Those attacks involve attempts to gain\nunauthorized access to our eCommerce websites (including marketplace platforms) or mobile commerce applications to obtain and misuse customers' or members'\ninformation including payment information and related risks discussed in this Item 1A. Such attacks, if successful, in addition to potential data misuse and/or loss,\nmay also create denials of service or otherwise disable, degrade or sabotage one or more of our digital platforms or otherwise significantly disrupt our customers'\nand members' shopping experience, our supply chain integrity and continuity, and our ability to efficiently operate our business. If we are unable to maintain the\nsecurity of our digital platforms and keep them operating within acceptable parameters, we could suffer loss of sales, reductions in transactions, reputational\ndamage and deterioration of our competitive position and incur liability for any damage to customers or others whose personal or confidential information is\nunlawfully obtained and misused, any of which events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of\nour strategy for the growth of our business.\nAny failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our company, customers, members, associates and vendors, whether as a result of\ncybersecurity attacks on our information systems or otherwise, could damage our reputation, result in litigation or other legal actions against us, cause us\nto incur substantial additional costs, and materially adversely affect our business and operating results.\nLike most retailers, we receive and store in our information systems personal information about our customers and members, and we receive and store personal\ninformation concerning our associates and vendors. Some of that information is stored digitally in connection with our digital platforms. We also utilize third-party\nservice providers for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, for digital storage technology, content delivery to customers and members, back-office\nsupport, and other functions. Such providers may have access to information we hold about our customers, members, associates or vendors. In addition, our\neCommerce operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments.\nCyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly\nsophisticated. Cyber threats and cyberattackers can be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of hackers with a wide range\nof motives and expertise. We and the businesses with which we interact have experienced and continue to experience threats to data and systems, including by\nperpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyberattacks, computer viruses, worms, bot attacks, ransomware or other destructive or disruptive software and\nattempts to misappropriate customer information, including credit card and payment information, and cause system failures and disruptions. The increased use of\nremote work infrastructure due to the COVID-19 pandemic has also increased the possible attack surfaces. Some of our systems and third-party service providers'\nsystems have experienced limited security breaches or incidents and although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no\nassurance of a similar result in the future.\n18\nAssociate error or malfeasance, faulty password management, social engineering or other vulnerabilities and irregularities may also result in a defeat of our or our\nthird-party service providers' security measures and a breach of our or their information systems. Moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may have\ninherent vulnerabilities or defects of design, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could\ncompromise information security.\nAny compromise of our data security systems or of those of businesses with which we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed, obtained,\ndamaged, disclosed, destroyed, modified, lost or used by unauthorized persons could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions, customer attrition,\nremediation expenses, and claims from customers, members, associates, vendors, financial institutions, payment card networks and other persons, any of which\ncould materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial position and results of operations. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized\naccess, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of a compromise, we may be unable to anticipate\nthese techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures and we or our third-party service providers may not discover any security breach, vulnerability or\ncompromise of information for a significant period of time after the security incident occurs. To the extent that any cyberattack, ransomware or incursion in our or\none of our third-party service provider's information systems results in the loss, damage, misappropriation or other compromise of information, we may be\nmaterially adversely affected by claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and others.\nOur compliance programs, information technology, and enterprise risk management efforts cannot eliminate all systemic risk. Disruptions in our systems caused by\nsecurity breaches or cyberattacks – including attacks on those parties we do business with – could harm our ability to conduct our operations, which may have a\nmaterial effect on us, may result in losses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations, or may have a cascading effect\nthat adversely impacts our partners, third-party service providers, customers, financial services firms, and other third parties that we interact with on a regular\nbasis.\nIn addition, such security-related events could be widely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, members, associates,\nvendors and shareholders, could harm our competitive position particularly with respect to our eCommerce operations, and could result in a material reduction in\nour net sales in our eCommerce operations, as well as in our stores thereby materially adversely affecting our operations, net sales, results of operations, financial\nposition, cash flows and liquidity. Such events could also result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and financial position\nand performance and could result in litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by\nour insurance policies. Moreover, a security compromise or ransomware event could require us to devote significant management resources to address the\nproblems created by the issue and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to guard personal and confidential\ninformation against cyberattacks and other attempts to access or otherwise compromise such information and could result in a disruption of our operations,\nparticularly our digital operations.\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, and our private label credit cards and gift cards, and we may offer\nnew payment options over time, which may have information security risk implications. As a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject\nto various industry data protection standards and protocols, such as payment network security operating guidelines and the Payment Card Industry Data Security\nStandard. We cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent, contain or detect\ncyberattacks, cyberterrorism, security breaches or other compromises from known malware or ransomware or other threats that may be developed in the future. In\ncertain circumstances, our contracts with payment card processors and payment card networks (such as Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover)\ngenerally require us to adhere to payment card network rules which could make us liable to payment card issuers and others if information in connection with\npayment cards and payment card transactions that we process is compromised, which liabilities could be substantial.\nAdditionally, we offer money (wire) transfer services, digital payment platforms, bill payment, money orders and check cashing and we sell prepaid cards and gift\ncards. We further offer co-branded credit cards and installment loans through financial services partners. These products and services require us to comply with\nlegal and regulatory requirements, including global anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and regulations as well as international, federal and state consumer\nfinancial laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, sanctions, penalties and harm to our reputation.\nThe Company also has compliance obligations associated with new privacy laws enacted to protect and regulate the collection, use, retention, disclosure and\ntransfer of personal information, which include statutory liability for security breaches. Consequently, cybersecurity attacks that cause a data breach could subject\nus to fines, sanctions and other legal liability and harm our reputation.\n19\nChanges in the results of our health and wellness business could adversely affect our overall results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nWalmart has retail pharmacy operations in our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments, as well as the recent addition of Walmart Health Centers in a number of\nstates. A large majority of our retail pharmacy net sales are generated by filling prescriptions for which we receive payment through established contractual\nrelationships with third-party payers and payment administrators, such as private insurers, governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers (\"PBMs\").\nOur retail pharmacy operations are subject to numerous risks, including: reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates for drugs; changes in our payer mix (i.e.,\nshifts in the relative distribution of our pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorable\nreimbursement terms); changes in third-party payer drug formularies (i.e., the schedule of prescription drugs approved for reimbursement or which otherwise\nreceive preferential coverage treatment); growth in, and our participation in or exclusion from, pharmacy payer network arrangements including exclusive and\npreferred pharmacy network arrangements operated by PBMs and/or any insurance plan or program; increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic\nprescription drugs we sell; increases in the administrative burdens associated with seeking third-party reimbursement; changes in the frequency with which new\nbrand name pharmaceuticals become available to consumers; introduction of lower cost generic drugs as substitutes for existing brand name drugs for which there\nwas no prior generic drug competition; changes in drug mix (i.e., the relative distribution of drugs customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands and\ngenerics); changes in the health insurance market generally; changes in the scope of or the elimination of Medicare Part D or Medicaid drug programs; increased\ncompetition from other retail pharmacy operations including competitors offering online retail pharmacy options with or without home delivery options; further\nconsolidation and strategic alliances among third-party payers, PBMs or purchasers of drugs; overall economic conditions and the ability of our pharmacy\ncustomers to pay for drugs prescribed for them to the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a third-party; failure to meet any performance or incentive thresholds\nto which our level of third-party reimbursement may be subject; changes in laws or regulations or the practices of third-party payers and PBMs related to the use of\nthird-party financial assistance to assist our pharmacy customers with paying for drugs prescribed for them; and any additional changes in the regulatory\nenvironment for the retail pharmacy industry and the pharmaceutical industry, including as a result of restrictions on the further implementation of or the repeal of\nthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or the enactment and implementation of a law replacing such act, and other changes in laws, rules and regulations\nthat affect our retail pharmacy business.\nIf the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted for any reason, our pharmacy operations could be severely\naffected until at least such time as we could obtain a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals. Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a\nsignificant number of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies.\nOne or a combination of such factors may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell, our cost of sales associated with our\nretail pharmacy operations, and the net sales and gross margin of those operations or result in the loss of cross-store or cross-club selling opportunities and, in turn,\nadversely affect our overall net sales, other results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nOur failure to attract and retain qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other labor issues could materially\nadversely affect our financial performance.\nOur ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates\nglobally. Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs,\ndistribution and fulfillment centers and corporate offices, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external\nfactors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate, unemployment levels within\nthose markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and\nregulations. Additionally, our ability to successfully execute organizational changes, including management transitions within the Company's senior leadership,\nand to effectively motivate and retain associates are critical to our business success. If we are unable to locate, attract or retain qualified personnel, or manage\nleadership transition successfully, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or\nimplemented that further increase our labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.\n20\nFinancial Risks\nFailure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.\nWe believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these\nexpectations, including our comparable store and club sales growth rates, eCommerce growth rates, gross margin, or earnings and adjusted earnings per share could\ncause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies, changes in our financial estimates and\nrecommendations by securities analysts or, failure of Walmart's performance to compare favorably to that of other retailers may have a negative effect on the price\nof our stock.\nFluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations.\nOur operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are\ndenominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expenses\nof our operations outside of the U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. In recent years, fluctuations in currency\nexchange rates that were unfavorable have had adverse effects on our reported results of operations.\nAs a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our Consolidated\nFinancial Statements reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in our\nfinancial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable currency exchange rate\nfluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our\nreported consolidated results of operations.\nWe may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the\ngoods will be sold. When we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable\nto us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with\na corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates have and may continue to adversely affect\nour results of operations.\nLegal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks\nOur international operations subject us to legislative, judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the\ncountries or regions in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance.\nIn addition to our U.S. operations, we operate our retail business in Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico.\nDuring fiscal 2021, our Walmart International operations generated approximately 22% of our consolidated net sales. Walmart International's operations in various\ncountries also source goods and services from other countries. Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors,\nmost of which are beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions, legal and\nregulatory constraints (such as regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory restrictions (such as foreign ownership restrictions) on eCommerce\nand retail operations in international markets, such as India), restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures), antitrust and competition law\nregulatory matters (such as the competition investigations currently underway in Mexico related to our subsidiary Wal-Mart de Mexico, in Canada related to our\nsubsidiary Wal-Mart Canada and competition proceedings in India related to our Flipkart subsidiary), local product safety and environmental laws, tax regulations,\nlocal labor laws, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, currency regulations, laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection,\nand other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future.\n21\nThe economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if\nthey occurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary\nand fiscal policies of the U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks\nassociated with having numerous facilities located in countries that have historically been less stable than the U.S. Additional risks inherent in our international\noperations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in\nenforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing\nbusiness outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and\nregulations.\nIn foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business\npractices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or the laws and regulations of other countries. We\nmaintain a global policy prohibiting such business practices and have in place a global anti-corruption compliance program designed to ensure compliance with\nthese laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from\ncountries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in business\npractices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if\nprohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation.\nChanges in tax and trade laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nIn fiscal 2021, our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club operating segments generated approximately 78% of our consolidated net sales. Significant changes in tax and\ntrade policies, including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we source many of the products we sell in\nour stores and clubs could have an adverse effect on our financial performance. A significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our U.S. stores and\nclubs is manufactured in other countries. Any such actions including the imposition of further tariffs on imports could increase the cost to us of such merchandise\n(whether imported directly or indirectly) and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers, which could materially adversely\naffect the financial performance of our U.S. operations and our business.\nWe are subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. The\ndetermination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. Our income taxes\ncould be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in\njurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in worldwide tax laws, tax\nrates, regulations or accounting principles.\nWe are also exposed to future tax legislation, as well as the issuance of future regulations and changes in administrative interpretations of existing tax laws, any of\nwhich can impact our current and future years' tax provision. The effect of such changes in tax law could have a material effect on our business, financial position\nand results of operations. In the U.S., the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") significantly changed federal income tax laws that affect U.S.\ncorporations and additional guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies is still pending. As further guidance is issued\nby these taxing authorities, any resulting changes in our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. Compliance with the Tax\nAct, including collecting information not regularly produced by the Company or unexpected changes in our estimates, may require us to incur additional costs and\ncould affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, in response to significant market volatility and disruptions to business operations resulting from the global spread of COVID-19, legislatures and\ntaxing authorities in many jurisdictions in which we operate may enact changes to their tax rules. These changes could include modifications that have temporary\neffect and more permanent changes. The impact of these potential new rules as well as any other changes in domestic and international tax rules and regulations\ncould have a material effect on our effective tax rate.\nFurthermore, we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects\nof changing tax regulations and legislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax\namounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods\nfor which such determination and settlement is made.\n22\nChanges in and/or failure to comply with other laws and regulations specific to the environments in which we operate could materially adversely affect\nour reputation, market position, or our business and financial performance.\nWe operate in complex regulated environments in the U.S. and in the other countries in which we operate and could be adversely affected by changes to existing\nlegal requirements including the related interpretations and enforcement practices, new legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicable regulations.\nOur operations in the U.S. are subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations including licensing and other requirements and reimbursement arrangements\naffecting our health and wellness operations. The regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: federal and state registration and regulation of\npharmacies; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; applicable governmental payer regulations including Medicare\nand Medicaid; data privacy and security laws and regulations including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the Affordable Care Act, laws and\nregulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of,\nhazardous substances; regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\") and the Drug\nEnforcement Administration (the \"DEA\"), trade regulations including those of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and consumer protection and safety regulations\nincluding those of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the availability, sale, advertisement and promotion\nof products we sell and the financial services we offer; anti-kickback laws; false claims laws; patient inducement regulations; and federal and state laws governing\nhealth care fraud and abuse and the practice of the professions of pharmacy, optical care and health care services.\nFor example, in the U.S., the DEA and various other regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances.\nWe are required to hold valid DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state controlled\nsubstance acts and related regulations governing the sale, dispensing, disposal and holding of controlled substances. The DEA, the FDA and state regulatory\nauthorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for\nviolations of these laws and regulations.\nWe are also governed by foreign, national and state laws and regulations of general applicability, including laws and regulations related to working conditions,\nhealth and safety, equal employment opportunity, employee benefit and other labor and employment matters, laws and regulations related to competition and\nantitrust matters, and health and wellness related regulations for our pharmacy operations outside of the U.S. In addition, certain financial services we offer or\nmake available, such as our money transfer agent services, are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, including those intended to help detect and prevent\nmoney laundering, sanctions, fraud and other illicit activity as well as consumer financial protection. We are also subject to data privacy and protection laws\nregulating the collection, use, retention, disclosure, transfer and processing of personal information, such as the California Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”),\nwhich was recently significantly modified by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), as well as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation\n(“GDPR”). The potential effects of these laws are far-reaching and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial\ncosts and expenses to comply. In the case of non-compliance with a material provision of the GDPR (such as non-adherence to the core principles of processing\npersonal data), regulators have the authority to levy a fine in an amount that is up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of global annual turnover in the prior year.\nThese administrative fines are discretionary and based, in each case, on a multi-factored approach. The CCPA and CPRA give California residents expanded rights\nto access, correct and require deletion of their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how\ntheir personal information is used. The CCPA and CPRA provide for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches.\nFurthermore, our marketing and customer engagement activities are subject to communications privacy laws such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. We\nmay be subjected to penalties and other consequences for noncompliance, including changing some portions of our business. Even an unsuccessful challenge by\ncustomer or regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from and defense by us.\nThe impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations, as well as changes in enforcement practices or regulatory scrutiny generally cannot\nbe predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and\noperational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the cost or attractiveness\nof the products or services we offer, or result in adverse publicity and harm our reputation.\n23\nWhile we strive to adhere our practices and procedures to these laws, they are subject to evolving regulations, interpretations and regulator discretion. To the extent\na regulator or court disagrees with our interpretation of these laws and determines that our practices are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we\ncould be subject to civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses, including: suspension of payments from\ngovernment programs; loss of required government certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs, including the\nMedicare and Medicaid programs in the U.S.; loss of licenses; termination from contractual relationships, including those with our drug suppliers and third-party\npayers; and significant fines or monetary damages and/or penalties. In addition, failure to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements in the U.S. or in\nany of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on\nour business operations, financial position and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position\nand liquidity.\nWe operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment. We are involved in legal proceedings, including litigation, arbitration and other claims, and\ninvestigations, inspections, audits, claims, inquiries and similar actions by pharmacy, healthcare, tax, environmental and other governmental authorities. We may\nalso have indemnification obligations for legal commitments of certain businesses we have divested. Legal proceedings, in general, and securities, derivative action\nand class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class\nactions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years.\nFor example, we are currently a defendant in a number of cases containing class or collective-action allegations, or both, in which the plaintiffs have brought\nclaims under federal and state wage and hour laws, as well as a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims\nunder federal and state consumer laws.\nThe Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled\nsubstance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids and is also a defendant in numerous litigation proceedings related to opioids including the\nconsolidated multidistrict litigation entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804), currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the\nNorthern District of Ohio. Similar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, health care providers\nand other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. On October 22, 2020, the\nCompany filed a declaratory judgment action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and the\nU.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, asking a federal court to clarify the roles and responsibilities of pharmacists and pharmacies as to the dispensing and\ndistribution of opioids under the Controlled Substances Act (the “CSA”). The Company’s action was dismissed and the Company is appealing the decision. On\nDecember 22, 2020, the DOJ filed a civil complaint against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Company\nunlawfully dispensed controlled substances from its pharmacies and unlawfully distributed controlled substances to those pharmacies in violation of the CSA. The\nDOJ is seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. In addition, the Company is\nthe subject of two securities class actions alleging violations of the federal securities laws regarding the Company’s disclosures with respect to opioids filed in the\nU.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on January 20, 2021 and March 5, 2021 purportedly on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock\nfrom March 30, 2016 through December 22, 2020. A derivative action was also filed by one of the Company's shareholders in the U.S. District Court for the\nDistrict of Delaware on February 9, 2021 alleging breach of fiduciary duties against certain of its current and former directors with respect to oversight of the\nCompany’s distribution and dispensing of opioids.\nThe Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from such claims\nand the related opioid matters.\nWe discuss these cases and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings\" and in Note 10 in the \"Notes to our\nConsolidated Financial Statements,\" which are part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n24\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions\nand proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could increase the costs for our shareholders to bring claims, discourage our\nshareholders from bringing claims, or limit our shareholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers,\nassociates or shareholders in such capacity.\nOur bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest\nextent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for claims, including derivative claims that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former\ndirector, officer, associate or shareholder in such capacity or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery.\nThe exclusive forum provision may increase the costs for a shareholder to bring a claim or limit a shareholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the\nshareholder finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, associates or shareholders in such capacity, which may discourage such lawsuits against\nus and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our bylaws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, the claims as to which they\nare intended to apply, then we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial position or results of operations. While the exclusive forum provision applies to state and federal law claims, our shareholders will not be deemed to have\nwaived our compliance with, and the exclusive forum provision will not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actions\nbrought under, the federal securities laws, including the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and\nregulations promulgated thereunder.",
